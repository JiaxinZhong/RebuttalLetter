  abstract = {Frequency and time domain solutions for the scattering of acoustic waves from an arbitrarily shaped target using the Kirchhoff approximation are developed. In this method, the scattering amplitude is analytically evaluated on a single triangle and scattering from a triangularly facetted target is computed by coherently summing the contributions from all the triangles that make up its surface. In the frequency domain, the solution is expressed in terms of regular (non-singular) functions, which only require the knowledge of the directions of the incident and scattered fields, the edge vectors for the triangles and position vectors to one of their vertices. To derive representations using regular functions in the time domain, the scattered signal is expressed by different expressions for various limiting cases. The frequency domain solution is validated by comparing its results to the solutions of problems for which the Kirchhoff approximation has analytic solutions. In order of increasing complexity, they include the square plate, the circular plate, the finite cylinder and the sphere. The time domain solution is validated by comparing it to the time domain solution of the Kirchhoff approximation for a rigid sphere.}

  abstract = {Lung sound signals are sensitive to environmental noise. Much research has been conducted on the enhancement of pulmonary sound. This study investigated the normal lung sounds as bronchovesicular (BV) and vesicular (V) signals and proposed a novel denoising method called SSA-DCT. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), the noise-related components were separated from respiratory information components. An algorithm was also proposed to determine the information and noise time interval, and by applying Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the signal energy was attenuated in the noise intervals. Moreover, the concept of safety component, which is secure against noise, was introduced. Then, an algorithm for automatic identification of BV and V signals using the safety component was presented. The error of this algorithm at SNR of 10~dB was 5\%. Lung sounds were recorded from 12 healthy subjects using four channels over the posterior chest wall. The signals were recorded in an acoustic laboratory and then contaminated with additive white Gaussian noise with different levels of SNR. The respiratory signals were also recorded in a relatively quiet environment with real ambient noise and denoised by the proposed method. The proposed method was compared with Coiflet wavelet decomposition with hard SureShrink thresholding. The denoising performance of both methods was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative approaches. The SSA-DCT method (e.g., at an SNR level of 10~dB) with average segmental SNR improvements of 2.52 and 3.44~dB for the BV and V signals, respectively, is significantly superior to the wavelet analysis with average segmental SNR improvements of 0.89 and 1.53~dB for the BV and V signals, respectively.},

  abstract = {A multizone sound field control method, called amplitude matching, is proposed. The objective of amplitude matching is to synthesize a desired amplitude (or magnitude) distribution over a target region with multiple loudspeakers, whereas the phase distribution is arbitrary. Most of the current multizone sound field control methods are intended to synthesize a specific sound field including phase or to control acoustic potential energy inside the target region. In amplitude matching, a specific desired amplitude distribution can be set, ignoring sound propagation directions. Although the optimization problem of amplitude matching does not have a closed-form solution, our proposed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) allows us to accurately and efficiently synthesize the desired amplitude distribution. We also introduce the differential-norm penalty for a time-domain filter design with a small filter length. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method outperforms current multizone sound field control methods in terms of accuracy of the synthesized amplitude distribution.},

This paper presents a novel array structure consisting of a set of parallel circular arrays of sensors to decompose a wavefield into spherical harmonic components. The new structure presented here provides an alternative design to the traditional spherical microphone arrays with increased flexibility on sensor locations. We use the underlying structure of the wave propagation together with the properties of the associated Legendre functions and the spherical Bessel functions to develop a systematic approach to place circular arrays and construct a hybrid array. As an illustration, we design a fifth-order spherical harmonic decomposition array using 57 microphones to operate over a frequency band of an octave and compare it with a spherical array. We use computer simulations to show the performance of the array in a beamforming example.},

We developed a neural network that takes 3DZDs of proteins as input and retrieves proteins of the same fold more accurately than direct comparison of 3DZDs.

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider physical reproduction of sound fields via planar and linear distributions of secondary sources (i.e., loudspeakers). The presented approach employs a formulation of the reproduction equation in spatial frequency domain which is explicitly solved for the secondary source driving signals. Wave field synthesis (WFS), the alternative formulation, can be shown to be equivalent under equal assumptions. Unlike the WFS formulation, the presented approach does not employ a far-field approximation when linear secondary source distributions are considered but provides exact results. We focus on the investigation of the spatial truncation and discretization of the secondary source distribution occurring in real-world implementations and present a rigorous analysis of evanescent and propagating components in the reproduced sound field.},

  abstract = {Near-field compensated higher order Ambisonics (NFC-HOA) and wave field synthesis (WFS) constitute the two best-known analytic sound field synthesis methods. While WFS is typically used for the synthesis of virtual sound scenes, NFC-HOA is typically employed in order to synthesize sound fields that have been captured with appropriate microphone arrays. Such recorded sound fields are essentially represented by the coefficients of the underlying surface spherical harmonics expansion. A sound field described by such coefficients cannot be straightforwardly synthesized in WFS. This is a consequence of the fact that, unlike in NFC-HOA, it is critical in WFS to carefully select those loudspeakers that contribute to the synthesis of a given sound source in a sound field under consideration. In order to enable such a secondary source selection, it is proposed to employ the well-known concept of decomposing the sound field under consideration into a continuum of plane waves, for which the secondary source selection is straightforward. The plane wave representation is projected onto the horizontal plane and a closed form expression of the secondary source driving signals for horizontal WFS systems of arbitrary convex shape is derived.},

  abstract = {The measurement of directivity for sound sources that are not electroacoustic transducers is fundamentally limited because the source cannot be driven with arbitrary signals. A consequence is that directivity can only be measured at a sparse set of frequencies—for example, at the stable partial oscillations of a steady tone played by a musical instrument or from the human voice. This limitation prevents the data from being used in certain applications such as time-domain room acoustic simulations where the directivity needs to be available at all frequencies in the frequency range of interest. We demonstrate in this article that imposing the signature of the directivity that is obtained at a given distance on a spherical wave allows for all interpolation that is required for obtaining a complete spherical harmonic representation of the source's directivity, i.e., a representation that is viable at any frequency, in any direction, and at any distance. Our approach is inspired by the far-field signature of exterior sound fields. It is not capable of incorporating the phase of the directivity directly. We argue based on directivity measurement data of musical instruments that the phase of such measurement data is too unreliable or too ambiguous to be useful. We incorporate numerically-derived directivity into the example application of finite difference time domain simulation of the acoustic field, which has not been possible previously.},

We present a method that overcomes the requirement for the baffle to be spherical. Furthermore, the microphones can be placed along a circumferential contour around the baffle. This greatly reduces the required number of microphones for a given spatial resolution compared to conventional spherical arrays. Our method is based on the analytical solution for SH decomposition based on observations along the equator of a rigid sphere that we presented recently. It incorporates a calibration stage in which the microphone signals due to a suitable set of calibration sound fields are projected onto the SH decomposition of those same sound fields on the surface of a notional rigid sphere by means of a linear filtering operation. The filter coefficients are computed from the calibration data via a least/squares fit. We present an evaluation of the method based on the application of binaural rendering of the SH decomposition of the signals from an 18/element array that uses a human head as the baffle and that provides 8th ambisonic order. We analyse the accuracy and robustness of our method based on simulated data as well as based on measured data from a prototype.},

The main core of this article is acoustic levitation which considered one of the most important levitation and manipulation method due to the recent advancements that made it proper to deal with any kind of materials. Here, we review the renowned three methods of acoustic levitation that already using in robotic non-contact manipulation which are standing wave, near-field and single-beam acoustic levitation. Then, we present a performance characteristic of the reviewed methods and the summary of controlling strategies, followed by conclusion and future recommendations for acoustic levitation methods as a non-contact manipulation.},

The measured sound field is decomposed into spherical harmonics, which enables the evaluation of the radiation pattern to non-probed positions. Additionally, the measurement setup allows the assessment of noise emission and psychoacoustic metrics at a wide range of angles. The obtained directivity patterns using a third-order spherical harmonic decomposition (SHD) are shown to exhibit low distortion with respect to the original measurements, therefore, validating the SHD as an adequate representation strategy. Furthermore, the noise emissions are evaluated, and the highest noise emission is observed in the  90° 90°  azimuth direction. The exterior spherical acoustic holography description is employed to evaluate psychoacoustic metrics at arbitrary far-field positions and validated on a reference microphone. The estimated psychoacoustic metrics are closely related to the target metrics, which allows for sound quality analysis at any point external to the drone.},

  abstract = {Sparse spiral phased arrays are advantageous for many emerging air-coupled ultrasonic applications, since grating lobes are prevented without being constrained to the half-wavelength element spacing requirement of well-known dense arrays. As a result, the limitation on the maximum transducer diameter is omitted and the aperture can be enlarged for improving the beamforming precision without requiring the number of transducers to be increased. We demonstrate that in-air imaging, in particular, benefits from these features, enabling large-volume, unambiguous and high-resolution image formation. Therefore, we created an air-coupled ultrasonic phased array based on the Fermat spiral, capable of transmit, receive and pulse-echo operation, as well as 3D imaging. The array consists of 64 piezoelectric 40-kHz transducers (Murata MA40S4S), spanning an aperture of 200mm. First, we provide an application-independent numerical and experimental characterization of the conventional beamforming performance of all operation modes for varying focal directions and distances. Second, we examine the resulting imaging capabilities using the single line transmission technique. Apart from the high maximum sound pressure level of 152 dB, we validate that unambiguous high-accuracy 3D imaging is possible in a wide field of view (±80°), long range (20cm to 5m+) and with a high angular resolution of up to 2.3°. Additionally, we demonstrate that object shapes and patterns of multiple reflectors are recognizable in the images generated using a simple threshold for separation. In total, the imaging capabilities achieved are promising to open up further possibilities, e.g. robust object classification in harsh environments based on ultrasonic images.},

  abstract = {The waves (including acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic ones) propagating in the presence of a cluster of inhomogeneities undergo multiple interactions between them. When these inhomogeneities have sub-wavelength sizes, the dominating field due to the these multiple interactions is the Foldy-Lax field. This field models the interaction between the equivalent point-like scatterers, located at the centers of the small inhomogeneities, with scattering coefficients related to geometrical/material properties of each inhomogeneities, as polarization coefficients. One of the related questions left open for a long time is whether we can reconstruct this Foldy-Lax field from the scattered field measured far away from the cluster of the small inhomogeneities. This is the Foldy-Lax approximation (or Foldy-Lax paradigm). In this work, we show that this approximation is indeed valid as soon as the inhomogeneities enjoy critical scales between their sizes and contrasts. These critical scales allow them to generate resonances which can be characterized and computed. The main result here is that exciting the cluster by incident frequencies which are close to the real parts of these resonances allow us to reconstruct the Fold-Lax field from the scattered waves collected far away from the cluster itself (as the farfields). In short, we show that the Foldy-Lax approximation is valid using nearly resonating incident frequencies. This results is demonstrated by using, as small inhomogeneities, dielectric nanoparticles for the 2D TM model of electromagnetic waves and bubbles for the 3D acoustic waves.},

The local inductive shunt resonant frequency of each unit cell is different and follows a predefined spatial variation along the beam length. We explore the effect of various grading profiles on the spatial wave trapping and on the attenuation bandwidth. Experiments are performed on a clamped-clamped metamaterial beam with 29 piezoelectric elements shunted to synthetic impedance circuits with gradually varying inductance. Numerical simulations and experimental results reveal that, over a frequency band containing all resonant frequencies of unit cells, propagating elastic waves can be trapped uniformly or nonuniformly along the beam, and that the spatial trapping pattern follows the respective target frequency grading profile. Additionally, substantial band-gap enhancement is observed (as high as 75\% increase) as compared with the identical resonators counterpart. Overall, the results show the versatility of this class of graded piezoelectric metamaterials and support the design of such programmable piezoelectric metastructures.},

Assuming an isosceles triangle antenna configuration, where three antennas are placed as the vertices of an isosceles triangle, the spatial location problem can be formulated as a non-convex optimization problem whose interior is shown to admit a Riemannian manifold structure. Our investigation of the geometry of the newly introduced manifold (i.e., the manifold of all isosceles triangles in \$\textbackslash mathbb R\^3\$) enables the design of highly efficient optimization algorithms. Simulations are presented to compare the performance of the proposed approach with popular methods from the literature. The results suggest that the proposed Riemannian-based methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed Riemannian methods require much less computation time compared to popular generic non-convex approaches.},

In contrast to previously presented fast algorithms for fast discrete Laplace transforms, the proposed algorithms are not restricted to the case of real exponentials but can deal with oscillations caused by complex valued nodes. Numerical experiments show that the computational complexity is comparable to that of computing ordinary discrete Fourier transforms by means of FFT. Results are given for the one-dimensional case, but it is straightforward to generalize them to arbitrary dimensions.},

Recent advances in acoustic levitation now allow not only suspending but also rotating and translating objects in three dimensions. Acoustic levitation is also no longer restricted to small objects and can now be employed to levitate objects larger than the acoustic wavelength. This article reviews the progress of acoustic levitation, focusing on the working mechanism of different types of acoustic levitation devices developed to date. We start with a brief review of the theory. Then, we review the acoustic levitation methods to suspend objects at fixed positions, followed by the techniques that allow the manipulation of objects.

  abstract = {Multichannel Active Noise Control (ANC) headrest systems have usually been designed with the objective of creating quiet areas at the passenger positions within the cabin of a public transport. Due to the high computational demands of dealing with multiple loudspeakers and multiple microphones by using a single centralized processor, and the convenience of a scalable system, a distributed implementation may be advisable. On the other hand, the addition of the remote microphone (RM) technique to the ANC headrest systems has recently allowed the creation of local zones of quiet at unachievable placements for the error sensors. This technique allows the quiet zone to be shifted to a desired location away from the physical sensor. However, to our knowledge, the implementation of an ANC headrest system with virtual microphones over a distributed acoustic sensor network has not been addressed. In this work, a distributed version of the multiple-error FxLMS (MEFxLMS) algorithm considering the RM method (RM-DMEFxLMS) is proposed by using an alternative formulation of the RM method. Through a set of simulations, it is found that on a non-constrained communication network, the proposed algorithm presents the same performance of its centralized version and provides a scalable and more versatile ANC system.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates the applicability of the mirror source method (MSM) to the prediction of the low-frequency modally dominated part of a room transfer function (RTF) in rectangular rooms with arbitrary, complex-valued boundary conditions on the room walls. It is known that the errors caused by application of the MSM with complex boundaries stem from the fact that the distances of sources, receivers to the boundary are not small compared to the wavelength. Thus, the study is focused on the 'practical' low frequency limit of the MSM. The study is based on the comparison of low frequency RTFs obtained from the mirror source and the finite element method (FEM), where the FEM results are considered as the reference. In order to allow the mirror source calculation up to very high orders, the study uses an efficient mirror source modeling algorithm for rectangular rooms which allows the assignment of individual frequency and angle dependent complex reflection factors to each of the six walls in the room. The simulation study focusses on four major aspects: (a) The quantification of the errors that are introduced by the mirror source approximation in the case of non-ideally rigid or soft walls as a function of frequency and average absorption in the room; (b) the simulation error due to the truncation of the MS calculation based on two different interrupt criteria (fraction of reverberation time and attenuation of mirror sources); (c) The impact of commonly applied simplifications of representations of the boundary conditions in the MSM (e.g.negligence of angle dependence of the reflection factor, negligence of the phase of the reflection factor) and (d) the influence of the proportions of the rectangular rooms. The presented results show that for moderately damped rectangular rooms of variable proportions the MSM provides a good approximation of the sound field already with reasonable reflection orders, if frequency and angle-dependent complex reflection factors are applied. The errors in narrow bands are typically below 1 dB in the frequency range above roughly once or the twice the Schroeder frequency but an increasing error in flat and long rooms is observed.},

In this work, the problem is mitigated by building an Omnidirectional Parametric Loudspeaker (OPL), which contains hundreds of small ultrasound transducers set on a sphere. Each transducer emits an ultrasonic carrier wave modulated by an audible signal. Thanks to nonlinear propagation, the air itself demodulates the signal bringing it back to the audible range. The construction of an OPL prototype is challenging. The structure has been built by 3D-printing a set of pieces that conform to the sphere. Each piece contains the exact location of the transducers, which are aligned in parallels to facilitate the structural assembly and the wiring. The performance of the OPL has been tested in an anechoic chamber. Measurements show that the OPL has a good omnidirectional behavior for most frequencies. It clearly improves the directivity of dodechaedral sources in the high frequency range, but performs worse at low frequencies.},

  abstract = {An omnidirectional parametric loudspeaker (OPL) is a sound source that is made of hundreds of ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers set on a sphere. Relying on the parametric acoustic array (PAA) phenomenon, each transducer emits an ultrasonic carrier beam modulated by an audible signal. Thanks to non-linear propagation in air, natural demodulation takes place and focused audible beams are obtained. An OPL thus emits hundreds of audible sound beams in all directions. In this work, the performance of an OPL prototype containing 750 transducers set on a sphere of radius 0.125 cm is examined in free-field conditions. The frequency response, sound pressure level (SPL) and directivity are measured using exponential sine sweeps (ESS). Compared to broad band signals such as white or pink noise, the OPL can produce higher SPLs with ESS because the acoustic power concentrates on a single frequency only. This makes the OPL suitable for room acoustic measurements. A conventional dodechaedral sound source is also measured for comparison. Results show that the OPL produces a better omnidirectional sound field above \$ 1 kHz, but it performs worse at lower frequencies. Moreover, it presents a flatter frequency response in all directions, although it generates lower SPL values. The Directivity Index (DI) required by the ISO 3382-2 and ISO 16283-1 standards has also been computed for both sources. The OPL cannot fulfill the requirements of the standard at low frequencies. This paper also demonstrates and discusses DI measurements of high resolution both for the new OPL and the traditional onmidirectional speakers.},

An OPL is made of hundreds of ultrasound transducers set on a sphere, each one emitting an ultrasonic carrier wave modulated by an audio signal. Thanks to non-linear propagation effects in air, the air itself demodulates the emitted ultrasonic signal bringing it back to the audible range. The carrier frequency fc is a critical parameter to the efficiency of the OPL and it is investigated in this work. To that goal, the performance of an OPL prototype consisting of 750 ultrasound transducers set on a sphere is evaluated for a large set of fc values, which are selected to be close to the resonance frequency of the transducers. Measurements are carried out in free-field conditions using (modulated) exponential sine sweeps as the excitation signal, which have recently proved useful to obtain a good frequency response, sound pressure level and directivity of the OPL in the audible range. That methodology is extended in this work to not only analyse the audible field but also the ultrasonic one. The measurements reveal that the OPL behaviour is very sensitive to fc, yielding to large variations in the ultrasonic and audible range. Therefore, when selecting an fc value, a balance must be found between maximizing the sound pressure levels in the low frequency range and preserving the sound field omnidirectionality, which is important for room acoustic applications.},

Drivers are typically set on the faces of a dodecahedron to generate an omnidirectional sound field. However, drivers become more directional as frequency increases, which causes a loss of omnidirectionality, especially in the vicinity of the dodecahedron edges. Several alternative devices have been proposed to remedy this problem. One of them, the Omnidirectional Parametric Loudspeaker (OPL), relies on the well-known parametric acoustic array (PAA) phenomenon. An OPL is made of hundreds of small ultrasound transducers set on a sphere. Each piezoelectric transducer emits a narrow collimated beam consisting of an ultrasonic carrier with an amplitude modulated signal. Thanks to non-linear propagation effects, the air itself demodulates the signal bringing it back to the audible range. As a result, a very omnidirectional sound field can be generated by an OPL, especially at high frequencies, since the density of transducers is very high.},

  abstract = {Metasurfaces as optically thin composite layers can be modeled as electric and magnetic surface current sheets flowing in the layer volume in the metasurface plane. In the most general linear metasurface, the electric surface current can be induced by both incident electric and magnetic fields. Likewise, magnetic polarization and magnetic current can be induced also by external electric field. Metasurfaces which exhibit magnetoelectric coupling are called bianisotropic metasurfaces. In this review, we explain the role of bianisotropic properties in realizing various metasurface devices and overview the state-of-the-art of research in this field. Interestingly, engineered bianisotropic response is seen to be required for realization of many key field transformations, such as anomalous refraction, asymmetric reflection, polarization transformation, isolation, and more. Moreover, we summarize previously reported findings on uniform and gradient bianisotropic metasurfaces and envision novel and prospective research directions in this field.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) thin film speakers produce sound with the thermoacoustic effect. Better understanding of the physical acoustic properties of these speakers will drive future design improvements. Measuring acoustic properties at the surface of the CNT thin film is difficult because the films, themselves, do not vibrate, are fragile and have a high surface temperature. In order to measure the surface particle velocity and sound pressure level (SPL), near field acoustic holography (NAH) has been used by employing probe microphones. NAH images the acoustic quantities of the source system using the set of acoustic pressure measurements on a hologram parallel to the source surface. It is shown that the particle velocity at the surface of an open-air, double-sided speaker is nominally zero, as expected. However, the SPL distribution is not uniform on the source surface, contrary to common lumped parameter model assumptions. Also, particle velocity and sound intensity distributions on the hologram have been obtained in this study. Finally, measured directivity patterns of the planar CNT speaker are reported.},

The ANC system excitation is a single-frequency noise with an adaptive feedforward configuration. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm is used to model the room acoustics due to a boxed loudspeaker of single frequency. A control system based on the filtered-x least mean-squared (FxLMS) algorithm is utilized to synthesize a cancelling noise using a secondary loudspeaker. The single channel system is modified into a multichannel system and genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the sensors and actuators placements simultaneously. Numerical results are plotted to demonstrate the performance of the control system. These show that the numerical modelling technique can be used to combine room acoustic simulation and FxLMS adaptive control. This provides a way for the optimum placement of the microphones and loudspeakers before being used in a practical complex enclosure.},

  abstract = {Acoustic metasurfaces derive their characteristics from the interaction between~acoustic waves and specifically designed materials. The field is driven by the desire to control acoustic wave propagation using compact devices and is governed by fundamental and physical principles that provide the design rules and the functionality of a wave. Acoustic metasurfaces have added value and unusual functionalities compared with their predecessor in materials science, namely, acoustic metamaterials. These rationally designed 2D materials of subwavelength thickness provide a new route for sound wave manipulation. In this Review, we delineate the fundamental physics of metasurfaces, describe their different concepts and design strategies, and discuss their functionalities for controllable reflection, transmission and extraordinary absorption. In particular, we outline the main designs of acoustic metasurfaces, including those based on coiling-up space, Helmholtz-resonator-like and membrane-type structures, and discuss their applications, such as beam focusing, asymmetrical transmission and self-bending beams. We conclude with an outlook of the future directions in this emerging field.},

These physically cross-linked hydrogels are composed of an aqueous solution of oppositely charged triblocks with charged end-blocks and neutral, hydrophilic mid-blocks. Due to their electrostatic interactions, the end-blocks microphase separate and form physical cross-links that are bridged by the mid-blocks. The structure of this system was determined using a new, efficient embedded fluctuation (EF) model in conjunction with self-consistent field theory. The calculations using the EF model were validated against unapproximated field-theoretic simulations with complex Langevin sampling and were found consistent with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements on an experimental system. Using both the EF model and SAXS, phase diagrams were generated as a function of end-block fraction and polymer concentration. Several structures were observed including a body-centered cubic sphere phase, a hexagonally packed cylinder phase, and a lamellar phase. Finally, the EF model was used to explore how parameters that directly relate to polymer chemistry can be tuned to modify the resulting phase diagram, which is of practical interest for the development of new hydrogels.},

  abstract = {Spectral decomposition of dynamical equations using curl-eigenfunctions has been extensively used in fluid and plasma dynamics problems using their orthogonality and completeness properties for both linear and non-linear cases. Coefficients of such expansions are integrals over products of Bessel functions in problems involving cylindrical geometry. In this paper, certain identities involving products of two and three general solutions of Bessel's equation have been derived. Some of these identities have been useful in the study of Turner relaxation of annular magnetized plasma [S.K.H. Auluck, Phys. Plasmas, 16, 122504, 2009], where quadratic integral quantities such as helicity and total energy were expressed as algebraic functions of the arbitrary constants of the general solution of Bessel's equation, allowing their determination by a minimization procedure. Identities involving products of three solutions enable expanding a product of two solutions in a Fourier-Bessel series of single Bessel functions facilitating transformation of partial differential equations representing non-linear dynamics problems into time evolution equations by eliminating spatial dependences. These identities are required in an ongoing investigation of fluctuation-driven coherent effects in a nonlinear dynamical system.},

The mathematical model utilizes the appropriate partial-wave expansion method in spherical coordinates, while Biot's model is used to describe the wave motion within the poroelastic medium. Of particular interest here is to examine the feasibility of using Bessel beams for (a) acoustic manipulation of fine porous particles and (b) suppression of particle resonances. To verify the viability of the technique, the radiation force and scattering form-function are calculated for aluminum and silica foams at various porosities. Inspection of the results has shown that acoustic manipulation of low porosity ({$<$}0.3) spheres is similar to that of solid elastic spheres, but this behavior significantly changes at higher porosities. Results have also shown a strong correlation between the backscattered form-function and the regions of negative radiation force. It has also been observed that the high-order resonances of the particle can be effectively suppressed by choosing the beam conical angle such that the acoustic contribution from that particular mode vanishes. This investigation may be helpful in the development of acoustic tweezers for manipulation of micro-porous drug delivery carrier and contrast agents.}

  abstract = {The effects of multiple scattering on acoustic manipulation of spherical particles using helicoidal Bessel-beams are discussed. A closed-form analytical solution is developed to calculate the acoustic radiation force resulting from a Bessel-beam on an acoustically reflective sphere, in the presence of an adjacent spherical particle, immersed in an unbounded fluid medium. The solution is based on the standard Fourier decomposition method and the effect of multi-scattering is taken into account using the addition theorem for spherical coordinates. Of particular interest here is the investigation of the effects of multiple scattering on the emergence of negative axial forces. To investigate the effects, the radiation force applied on the target particle resulting from a helicoidal Bessel-beam of different azimuthal indexes (m = 1 to 4), at different conical angles, is computed. Results are presented for soft and rigid spheres of various sizes, separated by a finite distance. Results have shown that the emergence of negative force regions is very sensitive to the level of cross-scattering between the particles. It has also been shown that in multiple scattering media, the negative axial force may occur at much smaller conical angles than previously reported for single particles, and that acoustic manipulation of soft spheres in such media may also become possible.}

Using the methods of small-angle X-ray scattering and light-scattering it was shown that LF in solution exists in oligomeric state. The level of LF oligomerization depends upon its concentration and time of keeping of no frozen neutral protein solutions. At the concentrations comparable with those in human milk (1-6 mg/ml) the average inertial radius values (Rg) of LF can reach 100-450 angstroms, while Rg for monomer LF form is 26.7 angstroms. LF was shown to complex with different nucleotides and hydrolyze them. The addition of ATP and AMP to LF demonstrating any level of oligomerization leads to increase of oligomerization processes and enhancement of the Rg values up to 600-700 angstroms According to different models of LF monomer association to its oligomeric forms (sphere, plate, cylinder) the oligomeric complexes demonstrate high Rg values which can contain from several tens up to several thousands of LF monomers. A possible role of LF oligomerization for different biological functions of the protein is discussed.},

  abstract = {In anechoic conditions, the Interaural Level Difference (ILD) is the most significant auditory cue to judge the distance to a sound source located within 1\,m of the listener's head. This is due to the unique characteristics of a point source in its near field, which result in exceptionally high, distance dependent ILDs. When reproducing the sound field of sources located near the head with line or circular arrays of loudspeakers, the reproduced ILDs are generally lower than expected, due to physical limitations. This study presents an approach that combines a sound field reproduction method, known as Pressure Matching (PM), and a binaural control technique. While PM aims at reproducing the incident sound field, the objective of the binaural control technique is to ensure a correct reproduction of interaural differences. The combination of these two approaches gives rise to the following features: (i) an accurate reproduction of ILDs is achieved at the head positions considered by the method, (ii) the ILD variations in the vicinity of those positions are smoothed, thus lowering the ILD error, and (iii) the true wavefront is preserved. Given the properties of the presented method, intended distance and directional perception is expected.}

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates that optimum weighting coefficients and inverse filters for microphone arrays can be accomplished, with the aid of a systematic methodology of mathematical programming. Both far-field and near-field array problems are formulated in terms of convex optimization formalism. Three application examples, including data-independent far-field array design, nearfield array design, and pressure field interpolation, are presented. In far-field array design, array coefficients are optimized to tradeoff Directivity Index for White Noise Gain or the coefficient norm, while in nearfield array convex optimization is applied to design Equivalent Source Method-based Nearfield Acoustical Holography. Numerical examples are given for designing a far-field two-dimensional random array comprised of thirty microphones. For far-field arrays, five design approaches, including a Delay-And-Sum beamformer, a Super Directivity Array, three optimal arrays designed using ℓ1,ℓ2,andℓ∞-norms, are compared. Numerical and experimental results have shown that sufficiently high White Noise Gain was crucial to robust performance of array against sensor mismatch and noise. For nearfield arrays, inverse filters were designed in light of Equivalent Source Method and convex optimization to reconstruct the velocity field on a baffled spherical piston source. The proposed nearfield design is benchmarked by those designed using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Tikhonov Regularization. Compressive Sampling and convex optimization is applied to pressure field reconstruction, source separation and modal analysis with satisfactory performance in both near-field and far-field microphone arrays.},

However, over the past few years, such an approach has been questioned due to several potential drawbacks, including the stringent parameter requirements, fundamental resolution limits, and noise. Here, exploring the consequence of nonlinear gain saturation in exceptional singularities of non-Hermitian systems, we offer a feasible scheme to overcome all the above difficulties. We provide a simple and intuitive example by demonstrating with both theory and circuit experiments an “exceptional nexus” (“EX”), a HOEP with an ultra-enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in only two coupled resonators with the aid of nonlinear gain. The tedious parameter tuning in a 6D hyper-dimensional space is reduced to 2D. The feedback mechanism of nonlinear saturable gain can give a solution to the ongoing debate on the SNR of EPs in other linear systems. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of the peculiar topology of nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, significantly reduce the practical difficulty in EP sensing, and possibly open new avenues for applications.},

  abstract = {Spherical microphone arrays have been studied for a wide range of applications, one of which is acoustic measurement and analysis. Since a minimal interaction between the array and the measured sound field is an advantage in this case, open-sphere arrays are preferable compared to rigid-sphere arrays. However, it has been shown that open-sphere arrays suffer from numerical ill-conditioning at frequencies which correspond to the nodal values of the spatial spherical modes with the result of excessive noise at these frequencies. A method for overcoming this problem using an open dual-sphere array is proposed in this correspondence and then investigated and compared to an array configured around a rigid sphere and an array composed of cardioid microphones. An optimal value for the ratio of the two spheres is derived, and simulation examples illustrating the advantage of the dual-sphere array are finally presented},

The beam pattern generated by the filter achieves a high directivity in a certain direction. Further, the beam direction can be rotated while maintaining the shape of the beam pattern. We implemented a prototype system that allows the listener to steer the beam direction using a gyro sensor in real time. The listening test result suggested that the location of the sound image varies based on the sound reflected from the wall. We evaluated the sound localization mechanism while rotating the beam direction based on the observed signal measured with a dummy head. The result showed that the sound of the beam reflected from a wall influences horizontal plane localization and sound image distance.},

  abstract = {Conventional energy sources are continuously depleting, and the world is actively seeking new green and efficient energy solutions. Enormous amounts of acoustic energy are dissipated daily, but the low intensity and limited efficiency of current harvesting techniques are preventing its adoption as a ubiquitous method of power generation. Herein, we implement a strategic solution to increase acoustic energy harvesting efficiency using a specially designed metamaterial. A scalable transmissive labyrinthine acoustic metamaterial (LAM) is designed, developed, and employed to maximize ultrasound (40 kHz) capture over its large surface area ({$>$} 27k mm2), which is focused onto a piezoelectric film (78.6 mm2), thus, magnifying incident sound pressure by 13.6 times. Three different piezoelectric films- two commercial and one lab-made nanocomposite film are tested with LAM in the acoustic energy harvesting system. We achieve an extraordinary voltage gain of 157 \%-173 \% and a maximum power gain of 272 \% using the LAM compared to the case without the LAM. We further demonstrate multi-point focusing using holographic techniques, showcasing acoustic patterning to allow on-demand simultaneous harvesting in separate locations. Our versatile approach for high-intensity acoustic energy harvesting opens future opportunities to exploit sound energy as a resource to contribute toward global sustainability.

  abstract = {This work aims to model the acoustic radiation forces acting on an elastic sphere placed in an inviscid fluid. An expression of the axial and transverse forces exerted on the sphere is derived. The analysis is based on the scattering of an arbitrary acoustic field expanded in the spherical coordinate system centered on the spherical scatterer. The sphere is allowed to be arbitrarily located. The special case of high order Bessel beams, acoustical vortices, are considered. These types of beams have a helicoidal wave front, i.e., a screw-type phase singularity and hence, the beam has a central dark core of zero amplitude surrounded by an intense ring. Depending on the sphere's radius, different radial equilibrium positions may exist and the sphere can be set in rotation around the beam axis by an azimuthal force. This confirms the pseudo-angular moment transfer from the beam to the sphere. Cases where the axial force is directed opposite to the direction of the beam propagation are investigated and the potential use of Bessel beams as tractor beams is demonstrated. Numerical results provide an impetus for further designing acoustical tweezers for potential applications in particle entrapment and remote controlled manipulation.},

The high heat capacity per unit area (HCPUA) of thin-film materials at that time limited the usefulness of thermophones. Recently, researchers of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have developed techniques to create a super-aligned thin-film of multi-walled CNTs, possessing extremely low HCPUA. This paper will discuss CNT thin-film loudspeaker theory as well as some initial investigations into the feasibility of a high-powered audio CNT speaker. The advantages of such a loudspeaker include: Ultra-lightweight, compact, no moving parts, low cost, and independence from expensive rare-earth materials.},

The optimization of a TR demonstration is described, which knocks over one selected LEGO minifigure among other minifigures by focusing the vibrations within an aluminum plate at the target minifigure. The aim is to achieve a high repeatability of the demonstration along with reduced costs to create a museum exhibit. By comparing the minifigure's motion to the plate's motion directly beneath its feet, it is determined that a major factor inhibiting the repeatability is that the smaller vibrations before the focal event cause the minifigure to bounce repeatedly and it ends up being in the air during the main vibrational focal event, which was intended to launch the minifigure. The deconvolution TR technique is determined to be optimal in providing the demonstration repeatability. The amplitude, frequency, and plate thickness are optimized in a laboratory setting. An eddy current sensor is then used to reduce the costs, and the impact on the repeatability is determined. A description is given of the implementation of the demonstration for a museum exhibit. This demonstration illustrates the power of the focusing acoustic waves, and the principles learned by optimizing this demonstration can be applied to other real-world applications.},

A diffraction model, based on plane wave expansions, is applied to weak nonlinear interactions between two ultrasonic waves propagating in an absorbing medium. A validation of the model has been carried out with an experiment performed using an optical interferometer. A method is proposed to measure nonlinearity parameters with the parametric interaction of two waves with a high frequency ratio. With respect to diffraction effects, the parametric interaction can then be identified with a phase modulation of the high frequency wave. A prototype, using the interaction of a 30-MHz frequency continuous wave with an acoustic pulse of central frequency 2.5 MHz, has been designed. The proposed method is validated by nonlinearity parameters measurements in well-known liquids (water and ethanol). The uncertainty on absolute measurements is discussed, and a relative method is proposed to increase the accuracy. This method enables measurements without any transducer calibration.},

  abstract = {All limitations commonly associated with imaging, such as resolution, field of view and depth of field, arise from linear theory1. Nonlinear optics can break these limits by exploiting the presence and interaction of many photons at once. To date, nearly all nonlinear imaging techniques have relied on point processes, such as two-photon fluorescence2 or harmonic effects3, in which the temporal frequency is the relevant parameter. These methods ignore the spatial content of the object, typically require scanning to record a whole image, and remain restricted by linear propagation from the sample to the detector. Spatial nonlinearity can overcome these issues by mixing modes with high and low spatial frequencies. Here, we generalize Abbe's theory of diffraction1 to include nonlinear propagation and show that wave mixing can be treated as a self-induced structured illumination. We demonstrate this experimentally by nonlinearly enhancing a standard imaging system beyond its conventional limits.},

Acoust., 3rd (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1960), p. 316] in terms of the coefficient of small‐amplitude attenuation, the first‐order pressure, and the virtual source density. This equation when applied to a plane wave yields an equation for the attenuation of the pressure amplitude, in terms not only of the small amplitude attenuation coefficient, but also the shock formation distance. This latter equation exhibits a smooth transition through the region of shock formation. An approximation applicable to the end‐fire array can be developed, and from this a compatible end‐fire virtual source distribution. This source distribution results in a directional pattern modified from the low‐amplitude Rutherford law [P. J. Westervelt, J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 35, 535 (1963)] by a multiplicative factor, which is expressible as a hypergeometric series. This series can be summed exactly on axis, and a simple closed‐form expression giving the reduction in sound pressure level due to saturation is found. These results, obtained independently by each of us, are to be published, flint in a Letter to the Editor by J. F. B. accepted by J. Acoust. Soc.

Firstly, we present a detailed comparative study between the proposed separable 3D moments and the classical ones in terms of global feature extraction capability under noisy and noise-free conditions. Also, their local feature extraction ability is examined. Secondly, our study investigates the ability of the proposed separable 3D moments in pattern recognition. For this, new sets of separable 3D discrete moment invariants are introduced. The proposed rotation, scaling and translation 3D moment invariants have been rigorously tested under different sets of mixed transforms. The obtained results show that the representation capability, in comparison with traditional Krawtchouk and Tchebichef moments, has been significantly improved by using the new proposed 3D separable moments and can be highly useful in the field of 3D image analysis.},

They are different from the regular insulators and they display novel quantum properties that also involve the idea of `topology', an area of mathematics. Some of the fundamental ideas behind the topological insulators, particularly in low-dimensional condensed matter systems such as poly-acetylene chains, can be understood using a simple one-dimensional toy model popularly known as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or the SSH model. This model can also be used as an introduction to the topological insulators of higher dimensions. Here we give a concise description of the SSH model along with a brief review of the background physics and attempt to understand the ideas of topological invariants, edge states, and bulk-boundary correspondence using the model.},

The beams can be constructed from a coaxial superposition of a fundamental Gaussian mode and a spiral-phase Laguerre-Gauss mode having orthogonal polarizations. When the orthogonal polarizations are right and left circular, the coverage extends from one pole of the sphere to the other in such a way that concentric circles on the beam map onto parallels on the Poincare sphere and radial lines map onto meridians. If the beam waist parameters match, the map is stereographic and the beam propagation corresponds to a rigid rotation about the pole. We present an experimental example of how a symmetrically stressed window can produce these beams and show that the predicted rotation indeed occurs when moving through the beams' focus.},

  abstract = {We extend the theory of dipole moments in crystalline insulators to higher multipole moments. As first formulated in Benalcazar et al. [Science 357, 61 (2017)], we show that bulk quadrupole and octupole moments can be realized in crystalline insulators. In this paper, we expand in great detail the theory presented previously [Benalcazar et al., Science 357, 61 (2017)] and extend it to cover associated topological pumping phenomena, and a class of three-dimensional (3D) insulator with chiral hinge states. We start by deriving the boundary properties of continuous classical dielectrics hosting only bulk dipole, quadrupole, or octupole moments. In quantum mechanical crystalline insulators, these higher multipole bulk moments manifest themselves by the presence of boundary-localized moments of lower dimension, in exact correspondence with the electromagnetic theory of classical continuous dielectrics. In the presence of certain symmetries, these moments are quantized, and their boundary signatures are fractionalized. These multipole moments then correspond to new symmetry-protected topological phases. The topological structure of these phases is described by “nested” Wilson loops, which we define. These Wilson loops reflect the bulk-boundary correspondence in a way that makes evident a hierarchical classification of the multipole moments. Just as a varying dipole generates charge pumping, a varying quadrupole generates dipole pumping, and a varying octupole generates quadrupole pumping. For nontrivial adiabatic cycles, the transport of these moments is quantized. An analysis of these interconnected phenomena leads to the conclusion that a new kind of Chern-type insulator exists, which has chiral, hinge-localized modes in 3D. We provide the minimal models for the quantized multipole moments, the nontrivial pumping processes, and the hinge Chern insulator, and describe the topological invariants that protect them., This article appears in the following collection:},

We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological phases of matter.},

B 27, 6083 (1983).] linked the Chern number, a topological invariant characterizing the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases, with the topology of dynamical periodic systems in one dimension. Here we demonstrate its counterpart for higher-order topology. Specifically, we show that adiabatic cycles in two-dimensional crystals with vanishing dipole moments (and therefore zero overall particle transport) can nevertheless be topologically nontrivial. These cycles are associated with higher-order topology and can be diagnosed by their ability to produce corner-to-corner transport in certain metamaterial platforms. We experimentally verify the corner to corner transport associated with this topological pump by using an array of photonic waveguides adiabatically modulated in their separations and refractive indices. By mapping the dynamical phenomenon demonstrated here from two spatial and one temporal dimensions to three spatial dimensions, our observations are equivalent to the observation of chiral hinge states in a three-dimensional second-order topological insulator.},

To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes H = H †, where the symbol † denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space – time reflection symmetry (𝒫𝒯 symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian 𝒫𝒯-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian 𝒫𝒯-symmetric quantum theories.},

  abstract = {This article derives the radiation impedance for two parallel pistons in two different configurations: baffled and unbaffled. For the former, the cylindrical system of coordinates is adapted to compute the self and mutual impedance of a piston between perfectly rigid infinite parallel planes. For the latter, spheroidal coordinates are used and declined for the case of two disks in free-space. The formulae for Green's function that respects Neumann boundary conditions are established in both configurations in order to compute the pressure field using the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Contrasting with the radiation impedance obtained for one single radiator, both systems exhibit resonant frequencies. The result of this study, validated in each case by a numerical method, can be used to predict the acoustic interaction of two vibrating systems for which their radiation surfaces are facing each other.},

  abstract = {In this paper, sound field reproduction is performed in a reverberant room using higher order sources (HOSs) and a calibrating microphone array. Previously a sound field was reproduced with fixed directivity sources and the reverberation compensated for using digital filters. However by virtue of their directive properties, HOSs may be driven to not only avoid the creation of excess reverberation but also to use room reflection to contribute constructively to the desired sound field. The manner by which the loudspeakers steer the sound around the room is determined by measuring the acoustic transfer functions. The requirements on the number and order N of HOSs for accurate reproduction in a reverberant room are derived, showing a 2N\,+\,1-fold decrease in the number of loudspeakers in comparison to using monopole sources. HOSs are shown applicable to rooms with a rich variety of wall reflections while in an anechoic room their advantages may be lost. Performance is investigated in a room using extensions of both the diffuse field model and a more rigorous image-source simulation method, which account for the properties of the HOSs. The robustness of the proposed method is validated by introducing measurement errors.},

These effects are shown by numerical simulations in a prototype lattice model and expose a different face of the non-Hermitian skin effect, by disentangling it from the need for boundaries. We identify a topological invariant responsible for the dislocation skin effect, which takes the form of a Z2 Hopf index that depends on the Burgers vector characterizing the dislocations. Remarkably, we find that this effect and its corresponding signature for defects in Hermitian systems fall outside of the known topological classification based on bulk-defect correspondence.},

As such, it becomes possible to incorporate, in a flexible manner, multipole sources without regard to direction or alignment with an underlying grid.

This remains the case for newer time domain volumetric wave-based approaches to simulation such as the finite difference time domain method. In this article, a spatio-temporal model of acoustic wave propagation, including a source term is presented. The source is modeled as a spatial Dirac delta function under the action of a series of differential operators associated with the spherical harmonic functions. Each term in the series gives rise to the directivity pattern of a given spherical harmonic, and is separately driven through a time domain filtering operation of an underlying source signal. Such a model is suitable for calibration against measured frequency-dependent directivity patterns and a procedure for arriving at time domain filters for each spherical harmonic channel is illustrated. It also yields a convenient framework for discretisation, and a simple strategy is presented, yielding a locally-defined operation over the spatial grid. Numerical results, illustrating various features of source directivity, including the comparison of measured and synthetic directivity patterns, are presented.},

In volumetric wave-based simulation approaches (including, e.g., the finite difference time domain method among many others), a direct approach is to represent such continuous source distributions in terms of a collection of point-like sources at grid locations. Such a representation requires interpolation over the grid and leads to common staircasing effects, particularly under rotation or translation of the distribution. In this article, a different representation is shown, based on a spherical harmonic representation of a given distribution. The source itself is decoupled from any particular arrangement of grid points, and is compactly represented as a series of filter responses used to drive a canonical set of source terms, each activating a given spherical harmonic directivity pattern. Such filter responses are derived for a variety of commonly encountered distributions. Simulation results are presented, illustrating various features of such a representation, including convergence, behaviour under rotation, the extension to the time varying case, and differences in computational cost relative to standard grid-based source representations.},

In this short contribution, it is shown that highly accurate optimised designs are available if particular features of acoustic wave propagation and numerical scheme design are incorporated: performance can be tuned to an acoustic wavenumber range of interest, taking into account numerical dispersion artefacts, and the interdependence of the solution to the acoustic wave equation at neighbouring time steps can be further exploited, leading to extremely compact locally-defined interpolation designs.

In comparison with the statistical theory, the proposed approach permits the prediction of the sound field by taking into account the sound source location and the receiver locations as well as the transition from one room to the other at the coupling aperture. Moreover, the diffusion model results match satisfactorily the experimental data in terms of sound-pressure level and reverberation times, both in the room containing the source and in the receiving room.

The method is based on the modal decomposition of a room's region-to-region transfer function, which is assumed to be known. We perform a numerical simulation of four sound sources in a reverberant room, and show that the localization method exhibits increased spatial resolution and distance focusing abilities when the region-to-region transfer function is incorporated.

  abstract = {Focused electron beam induced processing (FEBIP) is a direct-write nanofabrication technique that utilizes the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). It encompasses the sub-techniques of electron beam induced deposition (EBID) and electron beam induced etching (EBIE). Deposition or etching is driven by electron irradiation induced decomposition of gaseous precursor molecules adsorbed to a substrate. The nature of the precursor and substrate material determine whether deposition (EBID) or etching (EBIE) occurs. EBID enables high resolution, direct-write material deposition for fabrication of arbitrary 2D or 3D nanostructures. EBIE enables direct-write etching of select materials.  One of the key advantages of EBID is the capabilities for direct-write 3D nanofabrication. However, deposition kinetics are more complex for the fabrication of 3D nanostructures, relative to the deposition of planar (0 - 2D) structures. Previously published demonstrations of complex 3D nanofabrication using EBID, have thus far been limited to the utilization of a small parameter space, namely high electron beam energies and low beam currents. A thorough experimental and theoretical investigation of 3D EBID kinetics is performed to identify the underlying factors that make 3D EBID more complex than planar EBID. Experimental results are supplemented with simulations utilizing the Monte Carlo and finite element methods. It is concluded that electron beam induced heating, typically negligible in planar EBID, is the key factor differentiating 3D EBID kinetics from their planar counterpart. Heating is shown to occur by two mechanisms, (1) thermalization of primary electrons and (2) Joule heating. The former mechanism is active during planar EBID and only becomes significant for 3D nanostructures as a result of severely restricted heat dissipation. The latter heating mechanism is expected to be unique to 3D EBID. The effects of heating upon nanostructure morphology and means of controlling the heating are demonstrated. These results should aid in the optimization of future 3D nanofabrication with EBID.  EBIE has in general, received less research attention than EBID. Influences of multiple precursor species and orientation dependent etching in single crystal materials have not been examined. The influences of these factors is determined for EBIE of single crystal diamond using a thorough experimental and theoretical investigation. Experiments are supplemented with density functional theory calculations. It is shown that EBIE of diamond using oxygen gives rise to rapid, isotropic etching, whilst the addition of hydrogen gives rise to crystographically anisotropic etching and the formation of topographic surface patterns. The etch reaction pathways are determined and etch anisotropy is caused by preferential passivation of specific crystal planes by hydrogen adsorption. It is shown that the anisotropy can be controlled by the partial pressure of hydrogen and by using a remote RF plasma source to radicalize the precursor gas. It can be used to manipulate the geometries of topographic surface patterns on diamond, as well as nano- and micro-structures fabricated by EBIE. The process can be used to fabricate perfectly symmetric structures in diamond at the nano- or meso-scale and to selectively expose \{110\} and \{111\} crystal planes. The findings constitute a comprehensive explanation of anisotropic EBIE, and advance present understanding of electron-surface interactions in general.  The major limitation of EBID is the typically low material purity obtained. Thermally driven chemical vapour deposition (CVD) from the same precursors used for EBID, is generally capable of deposition of films of far higher purity and quality. In the final chapter, electron beam induced surface chemistry patterning, is used to enable selective, patterned deposition of metallic films by thermal CVD. Three surface chemistry patterning methods, all utilizing the electron beam of a SEM are examined. The efficacy of each method for restriction of thermal CVD deposition to the patterned surfaces, is evaluated for common precursors. A continuum model of selective CVD is also presented that aids the prediction of growth parameters for optimum selectivity of thermal CVD processes in general. The results pave the way towards realization of selective CVD processes, enabled by electron beam surface chemistry patterning, that may obtain the advantages of EBID, namely high spatial resolution and applicability to substrates of arbitrary composition and geometry, without the disadvantages of low material purity.},

  abstract = {Forward propagation of the transient sound pressure radiated by an impacted plate is presented. It is shown that direct and inverse time domain discrete Fourier transforms, involved in Fourier transform based near-field acoustical holography (NAH), lead to aliasing errors in the reconstructed time signals. Adding trailing zeros to the initial time signals is an inefficient way to reduce time aliasing errors. Hence, the numerical Laplace transform is introduced and a Fourier transform based transient NAH (TNAH) approach is formulated. An error measure is introduced to compare both NAH and TNAH with respect to the propagation distance and the location of the observation point in the projection plane. The percentage of error with TNAH is reduced by more than a factor of 10 without adding trailing zeros to the initial signals. Simulation results are validated experimentally using a free Plexiglas plate impacted at its center.},

In this work we show that in the electromagnetic context other Lambertian sources exist whose far fields, while obeying the cosine law for the radiant intensity, differ by their polarization states and degrees. For example, the far field may be azimuthally, radially, or circularly polarized, or the polarization state may vary depending on the direction. For specific Lambertian fields generated by quasihomogeneous sources it is possible to calculate explicitly the 3×3 electric cross-spectral density matrix of the nonevanescent part of the source. This enables one to assess the source's spatial coherence and partial polarization properties. In all cases, the coherence length turns out to be roughly half a wavelength, whereas the polarization characteristics of the sources may differ significantly. Our results could find uses, for instance, in radiometry and photometry, lighting applications, and remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotube thermophones can create acoustic waves from 1\,Hz to 100\,kHz. The thermoacoustic effect that allows for this non-vibrating sound source is naturally inefficient. Prior efforts have not explored their true efficiency (i.e., the ratio of the total acoustic power to the electrical input power). All previous works have used the ratio of sound pressure to input electrical power. A method for true power efficiency measurement is shown using a fully anechoic technique. True efficiency data are presented for three different drive signal processing techniques: standard alternating current (AC), direct current added to alternating current (DCAC), and amplitude modulation of an alternating current (AMAC) signal. These signal processing techniques are needed to limit the frequency doubling non-linear effects inherent to carbon nanotube thermophones. Each type of processing affects the true efficiency differently. Using a 72 Wrms input signal, the measured efficiency ranges were 4.3\,×\,10−6 − 319\,×\,10−6, 1.7\,×\,10−6 − 308\,×\,10−6, and 1.2\,×\,10−6 – 228\,×\,10−6\% for AC, DCAC, and AMAC, respectively. These data were measured in the frequency range of 100\,Hz to 10\,kHz. In addition, the effects of these processing techniques relative to sound quality are presented in terms of total harmonic distortion.},

  abstract = {ISO 3382-1 describes a number of objective room acoustics parameters that are generally accepted as useful for rating some specific aspects of concert hall sound fields. They include measures of decay times, energy ratios, measures of sound strength and several quantities related to the spatial aspects of sound fields. In most cases there are details of the measures, or their application, that raise questions. In general, there has not been a lot of practical research to explore how best to develop and use these objective measures to evaluate conditions in concert halls. For some well established measures such as Early Decay Time (EDT), we are not really sure how best to calculate their values. For other measures such as energy ratios, modifications are often proposed but without the support of subjective evaluations of the proposed changes. In other cases, such as measures of spatial impression, two approaches have been suggested, but their relative merits are not well understood. It is easy to propose ever more complex measures, but it is much more difficult to demonstrate their general utility. On the other hand, some commonly described characteristics do not have accepted related objective measures. Many more important and more general problems relate to the need, for design criteria in terms of each quantity, and for an improved understanding of just noticeable differences for each measure. This paper discusses each measure illustrating particular problems with measurements in various halls.},

  abstract = {The low-frequency behavior of acoustical transducers can be simulated with the so-called electroacoustical analogies (or lumped parameters). The main idea is that visual inspection of the transducer allows the derivation of an electroacoustic circuit that can be analyzed. The technique is computationally efficient and provides significant physical insight into the transducer. Electroacoustical analogies are taught today in many courses around the world. However, it is difficult to find reading material with an algorithmic approach to derive the electroacoustic circuit from the visual inspection of the transducer. This paper presents algorithms to derive the mechanical and acoustical circuits of transducer systems and how to couple the electrical, mechanical, and acoustical circuits for electrodynamic and capacitive transducers. A number of examples of the derivation are presented in detail. These techniques were conceived from an extensive search of the classical literature in acoustics and adapted to the teaching needs of undergraduate and graduate students of the Acoustical Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Maria in Brazil.},

The Sij in these papers denote the appropriate Mueller matrix elements. We compare graphs for different size parameters for both D(Theta,lambda) and the ratio R34(Theta,lambda)={$<$}S34{$>$}/{$<$}S11{$>$}. The ratio R34(Theta,lambda) was shown previously to be sensitive to diameters of rod-shaped and spherical bacteria suspended in liquids. The present paper isolates the effect of length changes and shows that R34(Theta,lambda) is not very sensitive to these changes, but D(Theta,lambda) is sensitive to length changes when the aspect ratio becomes small enough. In the present article, we extend our analysis to vegetative bacteria which, because of their high percentage of water, generally have a substantially lower index of refraction than spores. The parameters used for the calculations were chosen to simulate values previously measured for log-phase Escherichia coli. Each individual E. coli bacterium appears microscopically approximately like a right-circular cylinder, capped smoothly at each end by a hemisphere of the same diameter. With the present model we focus particular attention on determining the effect, if any, of length changes on the graphs of D(Theta,lambda) and R34(Theta,lambda). We study what happens to these two functions when the diameters of the bacteria remain constant and their basic shape remains that of a capped cylinder, but with total length changed by reducing the length of the cylindrical part of each cell. This approach also allows a test of the model, since the limiting case as the length of the cylindrical part approaches zero is exactly a sphere, which is known to give a value identically equal to zero for D(Theta,lambda) but not for R34(Theta,lambda).},

Two algorithms are described for the calculation of the binary holograms; one using ray-tracing, and one using an optimization based on direct binary search. It is shown using numerical simulations that when a binary amplitude hologram is excited by a train of laser pulses at its design frequency, the acoustic field can be focused at a pre-determined distribution of points, including single and multiple focal points, and line and square foci. The numerical results are validated by acoustic field measurements from binary amplitude holograms, excited by a high peak-power laser.},

Acoustic holograms, in particular, allow for the generation of arbitrary diffraction-limited acoustic fields at megahertz frequencies from single-element transducers. These are phase plates that function as direct acoustic analogs to thin optical holograms. In this work, it is shown that, by using multiple polymer three-dimensional (3D) printing, two-material (binary) acoustic analogs to “thick” or volume optical holograms can also be generated. First, an analytic approach for designing a volume hologram that diffracts a set of input fields onto a desired set of output fields is briefly summarized. Next, a greedy-optimization approach based on random downhill binary search able to account for the constraints imposed by the chosen fabrication method is introduced. Finally, an experimental test case designed to diffract the field generated by a 2.54-cm planar lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer onto eight distinct patterns dependent on the direction of the incident field is used to validate the approach and the design method. Field scans of the eight target fields demonstrate that acoustic analogs of optical volume holograms can be generated using multipolymer printing and that these allow the multiplexing of distinct fields onto different incident field directions.},

These shock waves have a three-dimensional spiral shape, from which both the longitudinal and azimuthal components are studied. The inverse filter technique used to synthesize AVs allows various parameters to be varied, especially the topological charge which is the key parameter describing screw dislocations. Firstly, an analysis of the longitudinal modes in the frequency domain reveals a wide cascade of harmonics (up to the 60th order) leading to the formation of the shock waves. Then, an original measurement in the transverse plane exhibits azimuthal behaviour which has never been observed until now for acoustical shock waves. Finally, these new experimental results suggest interesting potential applications of nonlinear effects in terms of acoustics spanners in order to manipulate small objects.},

We present a mathematical framework for the analysis of radiation characteristics from randomly distributed antenna arrays of the generalized circular topologies. Fourier probabilistic methods (i.e. characteristic function analyses) are applied to derive associated n-th order characteristic functions governing the radiation pattern. Sum and difference pattern behavior is generated using even and odd element distributions. Numerical simulations are performed using both ANSYS HFSS and MATLAB to demonstrate beam steering and examine the modal pattern characteristics. To validate our analytical approach, we include measured results of uniformly distributed array topologies, geometrically constrained to a set of 32 elements. Scanned patterns are provided for the sum-difference modes in both the E and H planes under lossless conditions. These are compared to theoretically-derived pattern behavior. The results demonstrate the utility of the CCF topology in generating radiation modes; because of this, applying the CCF in radar and electronic warfare technology will lead to greater performance such as enhanced target resolution and increased range capabilities.},

  abstract = {This work considers the use of secondary acoustic sources for the reduction of noise levels in harmonically excited enclosed sound fields. This possibility is studied initially through the use of an analytical model of a single frequency 'two-dimensional' rectangular, enclosed sound field of low modal density. Quadratic optimisation theory is used to predict the effectiveness of these active techniques for reducing sound levels. It is shown that if one chooses to minimise the total acoustic potential energy of the sound field then substantial global reductions in sound pressure may be achieved. The conditions required to achieve these reductions are discussed, and in particular the effect of secondary source location is demonstrated. The unsuitability of this as a practical control system cost function is discussed, and as an alternative it is suggested that one can minimise the sum of the squared pressures over a number of discrete sensors. Both theoretical and experimental results from using this cost function are presented. These show good agreement. The importance of both secondary source and error sensor locations is discussed. The reduction of low frequency propeller induced cabin noise is a possible application of active noise control. Simplified analytical models of the structural and internal acoustic response of a 48 seat, twin turboprop passenger aircraft are presented. These consist of the structural response of an isotropic, thin cylindrical shell of finite length and the acoustic response of the enclosed cyclindrical sound field. It is shown that, provided the external acoustic pressure forcing of the shell is modelled representatively of measured propeller pressure fields, then these simple models provide results which demonstrate good agreement with measured data, at least for frequencies encompassing the first two propeller blade passenger harmonics (88 Hz and 176 Hz). These models are used to predict the effectiveness of active noise control when it is applied to reduce the average sound pressure level over a typical seated head height plane in the passenger cabin. Results for the first two blade passage harmonics are presented for systems consisting of up to 24 secondary sources and 48 error sensors. In general the predictions suggest that active noise control shows promise as a potential method of reducing low frequency propeller induced cabin noise.},

  abstract = {This paper is Part II in a series of three papers on the active minimization of harmonic enclosed sound fields. In Part I it was shown that in order to achieve appreciable reductions in the total time averaged acoustic potential energy, Ep, in an enclosed sound field of high modal density then the primary and secondary sources must be separated by less than one half wavelength, even when a relatively large number of secondary sources are used. In this report the same theoretical basis is used to investigate the application of active control to sound fields of low modal density. By the use of a computer model of a shallow rectangular enclosure it is demonstrated that whilst the reductions in Ep which can be achieved are still critically dependent on the source locations, the criteria governing the levels of reduction are somewhat different. In particular it is shown that for a lightly damped sound field of low modal density substantial reductions in Ep can be achieved by using a single secondary source placed greater than half a wavelength from the primary source, provided that the source is placed at a maximum of the primary sound field. The problems of applying this idealized form of active noise control are then discussed, and a more practical method is presented. This involves the sampling of the sound field at a number of discrete sensor locations, and then minimizing the sum of the squared pressures at these locations. Again by use of the computer model of a shallow rectangular enclosure, the effects of the number of sensors and of the locations of these sensors are investigated. It is demonstrated that when a single mode dominates the response near optimal reductions in Ep can be achieved by minimizing the pressure at a single sensor, provided the sensor is at a maximum of the primary sound field. When two or three modes dominate the response it is found that if only a limited number of sensors are available then minimizing the sum of the squared pressures in the corners of the enclosure gives the best reductions in Ep. The reasons for this behaviour are discussed.},

Calculations were done as a function of frequency (100–2500\,Hz) and for source azimuths from 10 to 90 degrees using finite element models. The computations were compared to free-field measurements made with a manikin. Compared to a spherical head, the ellipsoid produced greater large-scale variation with frequency in both interaural time differences and interaural level differences, resulting in better agreement with the measurements. Adding a torso, represented either as a large plate or as a rectangular box below the neck, further improved the agreement by adding smaller-scale frequency variation. The comparisons permitted conjectures about the relationship between details of interaural differences and gross features of the human anatomy, such as the height of the head, and length of the neck.},

To reduce the sound field reconstruction area, stereo vision technology is introduced to continuously obtain the three-dimensional surface of the target and reconstruct the sound field on it. The fusion method can quickly locate the three-dimensional position of the sound source, and the computational complexity of this method is mathematically analyzed. The sound power level can be estimated dynamically by the sound intensity scaling method based on beamforming and the depth information of the sound source. Experimental results in a hemi-anechoic chamber show that this method can quickly identify the three-dimensional position of the moving source. When the depth of the moving sound source changes, the estimated sound power is more stable than the sound pressure on the microphone.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying |T|/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ |/spl Omega/| for some constant C/sub M/{$>$}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

  abstract = {We introduce UltraHaptics, a system designed to provide multi-point haptic feedback above an interactive surface. UltraHaptics employs focused ultrasound to project discrete points of haptic feedback through the display and directly on to users' unadorned hands. We investigate the desirable properties of an acoustically transparent display and demonstrate that the system is capable of creating multiple localised points of feedback in mid-air. Through psychophysical experiments we show that feedback points with different tactile properties can be identified at smaller separations. We also show that users are able to distinguish between different vibration frequencies of non-contact points with training. Finally, we explore a number of exciting new interaction possibilities that UltraHaptics provides.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the acoustic source distribution on aerofoils interacting with a turbulent flow. The source distribution is usually taken to be equal to the pressure jump across the aerofoil, whose behaviour is well understood from classical unsteady aerofoil theory. However, much of this source does not radiate to the far-field. This paper deals with the application of Fourier methods to extract the equivalent source distribution on the aerofoil that radiates perfectly to the far-field. This paper shows that, whilst the actual pressure jump across a flat plate tends to infinity at the leading edge while dropping to zero at the trailing edge (due to the Kutta condition), the equivalent source distribution is more uniform across the aerofoil chord, which explains why the radiation spectrum and single-frequency directivity both exhibit strong oscillations due to interference from coherent sources across the chord. A method for extracting this far-field equivalent source distribution from an array of far-field measurements is proposed in this paper.},

An alternative formulation of an objective function is proposed for heuristic calculation of the coefficients together with a procedure for reducing the dimensionality of the corresponding optimization problem to a quarter of its original size. The proposed objective function enables us to avoid numerical integration within the process of its evaluation in some practically important cases, which greatly speeds up the calculations. An evolutionary algorithm is employed for global minimization of the objective function resulting in determination of the multi-Gaussian beam expansion coefficients enabling us high-accuracy analytical calculation of acoustic (ultrasonic) fields radiated by planar sources. The calculated expansion coefficients are provided for the case of an axisymmetric uniform piston, a simply supported or clamped disc and a thin membrane. A simple relation delimiting validity of the approximation is found.},

Parameters of the GRIN PC lens are determined employing an optimization procedure that maximizes the minimum value of the primary-wave amplitude over a wide frequency range at a distant point in front of the transducer-lens system. The Westervelt equation is used as a wave equation taking into account diffraction, nonlinearity, and thermoviscous attenuation. The wave equation is solved numerically in the quasi-linear approximation in the frequency domain employing the finite element method.

This way, existing computational approaches for the Westervelt equation can be used even in situations where the generated acoustic field differs significantly from the plane progressive waves, such as in the near-field, and where the local effects manifest themselves strongly.

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a mathematical model of a sound-absorbing structure for anechoic duct termination, commonly called the acoustic black hole. The structure consists of a set of rigid rings separated by narrow fluid-filled cavities. There are holes in the centers of the rings, whose radii smoothly vary along the structure. According to the previously published works, wave speed in this structure can theoretically decrease to zero value, which results in the reduction of the reflection coefficient. The proposed model is based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations formulated in 2D axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates, which are solved numerically in the frequency domain employing the finite element method. This way, thermoviscous losses in the acoustic boundary layer adjacent to the fluid-solid interfaces, especially in the narrow cavities, are accounted for properly. The numerical results show that the absorption of acoustic energy in this structure is connected with resonances taking place in the cavities forming annular resonators, rather than with the acoustic wave slow-down. This effect has not been captured in the previously published models. It is shown that the geometrical details of the structure strongly influence its behavior, indicating the possibility of its optimization to serve as an efficient absorber of acoustic energy in a relatively wide frequency range.},

  abstract = {A method for generation of a wave-field that is a plane wave is described. This method uses an array of loudspeakers phased so that the field in the wave-number domain is nearly concentrated at a point, this point being at the wave-number vector of the desired plane wave. The method described here for such a wave-number concentration makes use of an expansion in spherical harmonics, and requires a relatively small number of measurement points for a good approximate achievement of a plane wave. The measurement points are on a spherical surface surrounding the array of loudspeakers. The input signals for the individual loudspeakers can be derived without a matrix inversion or without explicit assumptions about the loudspeakers. The mathematical development involves spherical harmonics and three-dimensional Fourier transforms. Some numerical examples are given, with various assumptions concerning the nature of the loudspeakers, that support the premise that the method described in the present paper may be useful in applications.},

  abstract = {The acoustic environment in an automobile cabin has a significant effect on the perceived quality of the vehicle. There are two components of the acoustic environment in the automobile cabin: the noise due to automotive processes and the sound produced by the car audio system. In both cases active methods can be employed to improve the acoustic environment and this thesis presents an investigation of both active control of automotive noise and active sound reproduction systems in cars. In the context of active noise control, cost-effective systems are investigated for the control of both engine noise and road noise. A model of structural-acoustic coupling is first derived and the effects of coupling on the performance of feedforward and feedback controllers is investigated. Feedforward control has been highlighted as a cost-effective method of controlling engine noise. In order to achieve low-cost active control of road noise, however, a number of multi-source, multi-sensor feedback active noise control systems are investigated. A modal feedback control system is investigated and shown to offer significant levels of control of a single dominant resonance. In general, however, a fully multi-input multi-output (MIMO) feedback controller is necessary to achieve control of the multiple resonances present in a road noise disturbance. Measurements have been conducted in a small city car to validate the proposed MIMO feedback controller and a real-time feedforward engine order control system has been implemented. Active control of sound reproduction has also been investigated with the aim of producing independent listening zones in the front and rear seats of the automobile cabin. Simulations have first been used to investigate the effect of implementing a personal audio system in a car cabin and to compare the performance of acoustic contrast and least squares optimisation strategies. In order to achieve control of the sound field over the full audio bandwidth two arrays are implemented, one employing the four standard car audio loudspeakers and one employing phase-shift loudspeakers mounted to the headrests. The performance of the system is validated using a real-time implementation in a people carrier.},

  abstract = {Active structural acoustic control (ASAC) is an effective method of reducing the sound radiation from vibrating structures. In order to implement ASAC systems using only structural actuators and sensors, it is necessary to employ a model of the sound radiation from the structure. Such models have been presented in the literature for simple structures, such as baffled rectangular plates, and methods of determining the radiation modes of more complex practical structures using experimental data have also been explored. A similar problem arises in the context of active noise control, where cancellation of a disturbance is required at positions in space where it is not possible to locate a physical error microphone. In this case the signals at the cancellation points can be estimated from the outputs of remotely located measurement sensors using the “remote microphone method”. This remote microphone method is extended here to the ASAC problem, in which the pressures at a number of microphone locations must be estimated from measurements on the structure of the radiating system. The control and estimation strategies are described and the performance is assessed for a typical structural radiation problem.},

  abstract = {Metamaterials have received significant interest in recent years due to their potential ability to exhibit behaviour not found in naturally occurring materials. This includes the generation of band gaps, which are frequency regions with high levels of wave attenuation. In the context of acoustics, these band gaps can be tuned to occur at low frequencies where the acoustic wavelength is large compared to the material, and where the performance of traditional passive noise control treatments is limited. Therefore, such acoustic metamaterials have been shown to offer a significant performance advantage compared to traditional passive control treatments, however, due to their resonant behaviour, the band gaps tend to occur over a relatively narrow frequency range. A similar long wavelength performance advantage can be achieved using active noise control, but the systems in this case do not rely on resonant behaviour. This paper demonstrates how the performance of an acoustic metamaterial, consisting of an array of Helmholtz resonators, can be significantly enhanced by the integration of an active control mechanism that is facilitated by embedding loudspeakers into the resonators. Crucially, it is then also shown how the active acoustic metamaterial significantly outperforms an equivalent traditional active noise control system. In both cases a broadband feedforward control strategy is employed to minimise the transmitted pressure in a one-dimensional acoustic control problem and a new method of weighting the control effort over a targeted frequency range is described.},

  abstract = {The broadband control of noise and vibration using multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) active control systems has a potentially wide variety of applications. However, the performance of MIMO systems is often limited in practice by high computational demand and slow convergence speeds. In the somewhat simpler context of single-input, single-output broadband control, these problems have been overcome through a variety of methods including subband adaptive filtering. This paper presents an extension of the subband adaptive filtering technique to the MIMO active control problem and presents a comprehensive study of both the computational requirements and control performance. The implementation of the MIMO filtered-x LMS algorithm using subband adaptive filtering is described and the details of two specific implementations are presented. The computational demands of the two MIMO subband active control algorithms are then compared to that of the standard full-band algorithm. This comparison shows that as the number of subbands employed in the subband algorithms is increased, the computational demand is significantly reduced compared to the full-band implementation provided that a restructured analysis filter-bank is employed. An analysis of the convergence of the MIMO subband adaptive algorithm is then presented and this demonstrates that although the convergence of the control filter coefficients is dependent on the eigenvalue spread of the subband Hessian matrix, which reduces as the number of subbands is increased, the convergence of the cost function is limited for large numbers of subbands due to the simultaneous increase in the weight stacking distortion. The performance of the two MIMO subband algorithms and the standard full-band algorithm has then been assessed through a series of time-domain simulations of a practical active control system and it has been shown that the subband algorithms are able to achieve a significant increase in the convergence speed compared to the full-band implementation.},

  abstract = {Acoustic Black Holes (ABHs) are structural features that are typically realised by introducing a tapering thickness profile into a structure that results in local regions of wave-speed reduction and a corresponding enhancement in the structural damping. In the ideal theoretical case, where the ABH tapers to zero thickness, the wave-speed reaches zero and the wave entering the ABH can be perfectly absorbed. In practical realisations, however, the thickness of the ABH taper and thus the wave-speed remain finite. In this case, to obtain high levels of structural damping, the ABH is typically combined with a passive damping material, such as a viscoelastic layer. This paper investigates the potential performance enhancements that can be achieved by replacing the complementary passive damping material with an active vibration control (AVC) system in a beam-based ABH, thus creating an active ABH (AABH). The proposed smart structure thus consists of a piezo-electric patch actuator, which is integrated into the ABH taper in place of the passive damping, and a wave-based, feedforward AVC strategy, which aims to minimise the broadband flexural wave reflection coefficient. To evaluate the relative performance of the proposed AABH, an identical AVC strategy is also applied to a beam with a constant thickness termination. It is demonstrated through experimental implementation, that the AABH is able to achieve equivalent broadband performance to the constant thickness beam-based AVC system, but with a lower computational requirement and a lower control effort, thus offering significant practical benefits.},

  abstract = {This work presents a scalable Column-Row-Parallel ASIC architecture for 3D wearable / portable medical ultrasound. It leverages programmable electronic addressing to achieve linear scaling for both hardware interconnection and software data acquisition. A 16x16 transceiver ASIC is fabricated and flip-chip bonded to a 16x16 capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) to demonstrate the compact, low-power front-end assembly. A 3D plane-wave coherent compounding algorithm is designed for fast volume rate (62.5 volume/s), high quality 3D ultrasonic imaging. An interleaved checker board pattern with I\&Q excitations is also proposed for ultrasonic harmonic imaging, reducing transmitted second harmonic distortion by over 20dB, applicable to nonlinear transducers and circuits with arbitrary pulse shapes. Each transceiver circuit is element-matched to its CMUT element. The high voltage transmitter employs a 3-level pulse-shaping technique with charge recycling to enhance the power efficiency, requiring minimum off-chip components. Compared to traditional 2-level pulsers, 50\% more acoustic power delivery is obtained with the same total power dissipation. The receiver is implemented with a transimpedance amplifier topology and achieves a lowest noise efficiency factor in the literature (2.1 compared to a previously reported lowest of 3.6, in unit of mPa - [square root sign]mW/Hz). A source follower stage is specially designed to combine the analog outputs of receivers in parallel, improving output SNR as parallelization increases and offering flexibility for imaging algorithm design. Lastly, fault-tolerance is incorporated into the transceiver to deal with faulty elements within the 2D MEMS transducer array, increasing yield for the system assembly.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an improved algorithm for active control of fan noise is proposed. The main idea behind this work is to reshape the frequency components of the reference signal using the information from the unwanted fan noise. In the algorithm, the reflection coefficients of linear prediction (LP) based on lattice structure are obtained from the noise. The coefficients are used to build an autoregressive (AR) model, which is applied to the reference signal to improve the correlation between the optimized reference signal and the noise. This method of spectral reshaping for reference signal (SRRS) is carried out automatically by an online adaptive process. The SRRS improves the control performance noticeably. The algorithm has a fast convergence rate and high stability with a tolerant increase in computational complexity. It is implemented to reduce the noise from a real fan on a digital signal processor (DSP) platform.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators first observed in electronic systems have inspired many analogues in photonic and phononic crystals in which remarkable one-way propagation edge states are supported by topologically nontrivial band gaps. Such band gaps can be achieved by breaking the time-reversal symmetry to lift the degeneracy associated with Dirac cones at the corners of the Brillouin zone. Here, we report on our construction of a phononic crystal exhibiting a Dirac-like cone in the Brillouin zone center. We demonstrate that simultaneously breaking the time-reversal symmetry and altering the geometric size of the unit cell result in a topological transition that we verify by the Chern number calculation and edge-mode analysis. We develop a complete model based on the tight binding to uncover the physical mechanisms of the topological transition. Both the model and numerical simulations show that the topology of the band gap is tunable by varying both the velocity field and the geometric size; such tunability may dramatically enrich the design and use of acoustic topological insulators.},

However, they are complex in realization and cannot directly manipulate acoustic near-fields by controlling the effective path length. Here, we propose a comprehensive paradigm for acoustic metasurfaces to extend the wave manipulations to both far- and near-fields and markedly reduce the implementation complexity with a simple structure, which consists of an array of deep-subwavelength-spaced slits perforated in a thin plate. A semi-analytical approach for such a design is established using a microscopic coupled-wave model, which reveals that the acoustic diffractive pattern at every slit exit is the sum of the initial transmission and the secondary scatterings of the coupled fields from other slits. For proof-of-concept, we examine two metasurface lenses for sound focusing within and beyond the diffraction limit. This work provides a feasible strategy for creating ultra-compact acoustic components with versatile potentials.},

However, Willis coupling coefficients designed so far are intrinsically coupled, which inhibits their full implementation in structural dynamic applications. This work presents a means to eliminate these limitations by introducing an active scatterer in a mechanical meta-layer that exploits piezoelectric sensor–actuator pairs controlled by digital circuits. We experimentally demonstrate abilities of the Willis meta-layer, in beams and plates, for independently engineering transmission and reflection coefficients of flexural waves in both amplitude and phase and nonreciprocal wave propagations. The meta-layer is described by a flexural wave polarizability tensor, which captures independent higher-order symmetric-to-symmetric and symmetric-to-antisymmetric couplings. The active meta-layer is adaptive in real time for reconfigurable broadband operation thanks to its programmability. This work sheds a new light on unsurpassed control of elastic waves, ranging from vibration protections to ultrasonic sensing and evaluation of engineering structures.},

The breaking of chiral symmetry leads to several important consequences, including a shift of the boundary mode energies. Here, we systematically study the coupled acoustic-cavity system (CACS), which is an important acoustic platform for realizing tight-binding models (TBMs). We find that the length and number of coupling waveguides not only affect hopping, but also induce a perturbation to the onsite eigenfrequency, which can be attributed to the breaking of chiral symmetry in the TBM. The acoustic origin of these phenomena is discussed, and the conditions of the exact realization of TBMs are identified. Meanwhile, we build an acoustic second-order topological insulator by extending the SSH model to two dimensions and show that the frequency of the topological corner modes is tunable by the same chiral-symmetry-breaking term. This finding is experimentally validated through the demonstration of in-gap and in-band topological corner modes. Our study provides a detailed and accurate understanding of the CACS and clarifies several important nuances for realizing tight-binding systems in acoustics. These results solidify CACS as a foundation for future studies of topological acoustics and non-Hermitian acoustics.},

This principle has laid the foundation for the development of lasers, quantum optics, sonar, musical instruments and other fields related to wave–matter interaction. In the conventional wisdom, the environment is defined exclusively by its eigenstates, and an emitter radiates into and interacts with these eigenstates. Here we show experimentally that this scenario breaks down at a non-Hermitian degeneracy known as an exceptional point. We find a chirality-reversal phenomenon in a ring cavity where the radiation field reveals the missing dimension of the Hilbert space, known as the Jordan vector. This phenomenon demonstrates that the radiation field of an emitter can become fully decoupled from the eigenstates of its environment. The generality of this striking phenomenon in wave–matter interaction is experimentally confirmed in both electromagnetic and acoustic systems. Our finding transforms the fundamental understanding of light–matter interaction and wave–matter interaction in general, and enriches the intriguing physics of exceptional points.},

  abstract = {The phase-shifting based active noise control (ANC) algorithm without secondary path modeling is appealing due to its simple implementation and high computational efficiency. However, the algorithm suffers from the influence of an implicit circular convolution caused by directly applying the most appropriate phase shift to the reference signal in the frequency domain. The implicit circular convolution results in a poor linear relationship between the phase-shifted reference signal and the error signal, which considerably degrades the convergence performance of the ANC system. In this paper, two methods are proposed to deal with this problem. In the first method, the circular wraparound artifacts are removed by the time-domain constraining operation. In the second method, a noncausal phase-shifting filter is used to regularize the phase of the reference signal. Compared with the standard frequency-domain implementation, the two proposed algorithms both eliminate the influence caused by the wraparound artifacts of the circular convolution and improve the linear relationship between the phase-shifted reference signal and the error signal, leading to a higher level of noise attenuation with a tolerable increase in computational complexity. Simulation results validate the better noise attenuation ability of the proposed algorithms.},

We explore multiple topological phases by introducing rich spatial frequency or enlarged range of the hopping modulation. Such distinct topological phases are evidenced by adiabatic evolution of the edge states, where the acoustic system varies continuously and slowly along the state propagating direction. The robustness behavior of the edge states transport is also verified with numerical simulations to imply their topology origin.

Its realizations in quantum systems often rely on the dynamic winding of anyons, which can be challenging to obtain. Implementing braiding in a classical system could, therefore, assist the experimental study of non-Abelian physics. Here we present the realization of the non-Abelian braiding of multiple degenerate acoustic waveguide modes. The dynamics of non-Abelian braiding can be captured by the non-Abelian Berry–Wilczek–Zee phase that connects the holonomic adiabatic evolutions of multiple degenerate states. The cyclic evolution of degenerate states induces a non-Abelian geometric phase, manifesting as the exchange of states.

  abstract = {Disclinations—topological defects ubiquitously existing in various materials—can reveal the intrinsic band topology of the hosting material through the bulk-disclination correspondence. In low-dimensional materials and nanostructure such as graphene and fullerenes, disclinations yield curved surfaces and emergent non-Euclidean geometries that are crucial in understanding the properties of these materials. However, the bulk-disclination correspondence has never been studied in non-Euclidean geometry, nor in systems with p-orbital physics. Here, by creating p-orbital topological acoustic metamaterials with disclination-induced conic and hyperbolic surfaces, we demonstrate the rich emergent bound states arising from the interplay among the real-space geometry, the bulk band topology, and the p-orbital physics. This phenomenon is confirmed by clear experimental evidence that is consistent with theory and simulations. Our experiment paves the way toward topological phenomena in non-Euclidean geometries and will stimulate interesting research on, e.g., topological phenomena for electrons in nanomaterials with curved surfaces.},

Using a theoretical model analogous to electrostatic interactions, we provide an efficient approach to evaluate intra- and interlattice couplings, whose competition is the major physical reason arousing the quantum spin Hall effect. The intralattice coupling is from the intrinsic design of the acoustic metamaterial, and the interlattice coupling is affected by multiple scattering among periodic scatterers. By independently manipulating the acoustic metamaterial and sonic crystal, we can successfully induce topological phase transitions at will. An alternative type of topological material is thus realized with great tunability. With identical building blocks for all hybrid topological acoustic metamaterials, a simple tuning of the corotation angle of each acoustic metamaterial can directly induce a topological phase transition, which makes the reconfiguration of the topological domains very convenient. A tunable multiport acoustic power divider is designed and demonstrated using numerical simulations and experiments. An alternative method to control the transmission rate and direction is thus reached and alternative routes for designing hybrid topological acoustic metamaterials with different functionalities and versatile applications are thus paved.},

This paper investigates the performance robustness of an active headrest with virtual microphones against the head rotation in a pure tone diffracted diffuse sound field. A physical model of a headrest system with a diffractive sphere is firstly developed, based on which the influence of acoustic transfer responses on the performance robustness against head rotation is analyzed. Then, the multi-objective optimization with constraints is developed to improve the performance robustness of the system, by designing optimized plant responses. Simulation results show that the method is effective in improving the robustness of single and dual channel systems. For a dual-channel headrest system with the proposed arrangements of secondary sources and microphones, the promotion of the minimum noise reduction is more than 7 dB after optimization when the head rotates from −90 degrees to 90 degrees at 125 Hz, 250 Hz and 500 Hz. In addition, the influence of different parameters on the optimization method is discussed for this dual-channel system. Finally, experiments carried out in an ordinary room validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a non-reciprocal acoustic system composed of three compact cavities interlinked with both dynamic and static couplings, in which phase-correlated modulations induce a synthetic magnetic flux that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Within the rotating wave approximation, the transport properties of the system are controlled to efficiently realize large non-reciprocal acoustic transport. By optimizing the coupling strengths and modulation phases, we achieve frequency-preserved unidirectional transport with 45-dB isolation ratio and 0.85 forward transmission. Our results open to the realization of acoustic nonreciprocal technologies with high efficiency and large isolation, and offer a route towards Floquet topological insulators for sound.},

  abstract = {A single microphone can’t select an efficient target signal from a mixed sound source when measuring the sound pressure level (SPL) of a target noise source in an outdoor environment. Therefore, a microphone array is used to enhance the target signal through beamforming to restrain the interference of non-target signals effectively. Owing to their advantages of small size and low price, micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) microphone arrays are widely used. However, MEMS microphone mismatch commonly occurs due to production tolerances as well as aging effects. To calibrate the SPL measurement difference caused by the whole mismatch microphone array when outdoor noise monitoring is performed, a real-time calibration method was introduced in this study by compensating for the SPL difference between the reference microphone and MEMS microphone array. The circular harmonics domain-multiple signal classification sound source localization algorithm was utilized to select the effective target signal component in the time–frequency domain, and the standard transfer functions of the reference microphone were utilized to correct the SPL measurement bias of the array. To verify the feasibility of the method, the consistency of the compensating SPL difference between multi-noise and single-target noise environments was experimentally investigated. The calibration method exhibited good accuracy and robustness based on the results and can also be applied to spherical microphone array noise monitoring device.},

In a finite-size configuration, such a topological pump displays edge modes that emerge dynamically from one bulk band and dive into the opposite bulk band, an effect that can be reproduced with both quantum and classical systems. Here, we report the first unassisted dynamic energy transfer across a metamaterial, via pumping of such topological edge modes. The system is a topological aperiodic acoustic crystal, with a phason that can be fast and periodically driven in adiabatic cycles. When one edge of the metamaterial is excited in a topological forbidden range of frequencies, a microphone placed at the other edge starts to pick up a signal as soon as the pumping process is set in motion. In contrast, the microphone picks no signal when the forbidden range of frequencies is nontopological.},

  abstract = {The Willis material model, coupling kinetic energy with a potential one, is shown to equip an extraordinary capacity in characterizing complex acoustic and elastic wave phenomena of metamaterials. This model has been further extended to active systems via breaking the symmetry between two coupling coefficients, leading to odd or non-reciprocal Willis material models [Quan et al., Nat. Commun. 12(1), 2615 (2021)]. In this work, through a 2D homogenous non-reciprocal acoustic Willis material (NRAWM), we demonstrate that the bulk local mode, referred to as skin effect in non-Hermitian systems, can survive on boundary of NRAWMs under proper conditions. The direction of the localization is closely related to the intrinsic direction embedded in the NRAWMs, and the localization is robust and topologically protected. To validate the prediction, a 2D discrete lattice made of non-local active acoustic scatterers is proposed and then homogenized as a NRAWM based on the retrieval method. The far-field radiation patterns of the local modes for both the 2D discrete lattice and the homogenized 2D NRAWM are evaluated, and they are in good agreement with each other. This work paves the way to design and explore the rich wave phenomena in non-Hermitian acoustic systems.},

We predict theoretically and demonstrate experimentally an asymmetric topological pumping when the injected field transfers from one side of the waveguide array to the other side whereas the reverse process is unexpectedly forbidden. Our finding could open an avenue for exploring topological photonics that enables nontrivial topological phenomena and designs in photonics driven by nonparaxiality.},

  abstract = {Metagratings are a recently proposed class of metasurfaces for efficient manipulation of an impinging wavefront within a subwavelength layer. They avoid the requirement for fine discretization of gradient metasurfaces, and overcome their inherent limitations in efficiency. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the functioning principle of a reconfigurable acoustic metagrating for anomalous reflection with high efficiency, using coarse geometric design features. It is formed by a periodic array of C-shaped meta-atoms, which exhibit large Willis coupling, resulting in a controlled level of asymmetry in their scattering pattern. Our results reveal that the proposed acoustic metagrating can reroute an incident wave towards a large angle, beyond the limitations of gradient-phase approaches with nearly unitary reflection efficiency. The proposed designs offer a highly efficient tunable platform to control steering angle and operating frequency. In our experiments, an acoustic wave is successfully steered to the desired reflection direction by finite metagratings, demonstrating reconfigurability in angle and operating frequency.},

  abstract = {Nearfield acoustical holography (NAH) is a useful tool for visualizing noise sources. However, to avoid spatial Fourier transform-related truncation effects, the measurement, or hologram, surface must extend beyond the source to a region where the sound pressure drops to a level significantly lower than the peak level within the measurement aperture. Statistically optimized nearfield acoustical holography (SONAH), first derived by Steiner and Hald in planar geometry, is based on a formulation similar to that of NAH. However, in SONAH, surface-to-surface projection of the sound field is performed by using a transfer matrix defined in such a way that all propagating waves and a weighted set of evanescent waves are projected with optimal average accuracy: i.e., no spatial Fourier transforms are performed. Thus the requirement that the measurement surface be extended is eliminated without compromising the accuracy of the procedure. In the present work, SONAH was re-formulated in cylindrical coordinates and was applied to the measurement of the sound field radiated by a refrigeration compressor. It was found that it is possible to visualize source regions accurately by using SONAH while using fewer measurement positions than would be required to achieve a similar level of accuracy when using conventional NAH procedures.},

A virtual sound source that generates the desired sound field can be located at either the outside or inside a loudspeaker array; however, a complete reproduction of the virtual source located inside the array is physically not possible because the sound field from the internal virtual source should satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation. When time reversal is used for removing such inhomogeneity, convergent waves toward the location of the virtual source always exist. The removal of these artifacts is an objective of our study. Most of the theoretical forms for the suppression of artifacts have been derived from the approximated Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral incorporating a curved or line array. In this paper, we aim to develop a method based on a complete three-dimensional integral formula, which does not require an inversion of sound fields. Using the formula, we can directly predict the behavior of artifacts and design the excitation of the loudspeakers that effectively suppresses the artifacts. This paper also highlights a single-layer formula that only incorporates monopole arrays for the reproduction of the virtual source inside them.},

  abstract = {It has been known that we can make a certain region of more acoustic energy than others. This can be achieved by utilizing loudspeaker arrays and designing a multichannel filter that effectively controls interferences of sound waves in space and time. The concept of a bright and dark zone[Choi and Kim, “Generation of an acoustically bright zone with an illuminated region using multiple sources,” J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 111(4), 1695-1700, Apr. 2002] showed that this idea can be realized in practice. Then we attempted to make a “sound ball” that utilizes the concept of bright and dark zone for generating a small spatial region of concentrated sound energy inside. The 32 speaker system which surrounds the zone of interest tried to implement the ball that can be positioned and also allowed to be moved. However, it was also found that the solution based on the bright and dark zones control does not, in strict sense, guarantee an effective radiation of sound from the ball. Understanding this inherent limitation motivated us to design a novel mean to have a sound ball that can radiate effectively. This has to solve the well-known Kirchhoff-Helmholtz equation for the case of which the source or sources are surrounded by an array of speakers. The sound ball is implemented by using a 50-channel spherical loudspeaker array, in which the loudspeakers are positioned on the Lebedev quadrature grid.},

  abstract = {We derived an integral equation for reproducing the sound field of a virtual source inside an array of loudspeakers with reduced radiation to the outside. Reproduction of a sound field over a finite interior region inevitably generates sound waves that propagate outside the region. This undesirable radiation is reflected from walls and can induce artifacts in the interior region. In principle, the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (KH) integral can be used to reproduce the interior sound field from an exterior virtual source without any external radiation. However, if there is a virtual source inside the array, the integral formula does not explicitly demonstrate how one can reproduce the sound field or minimize the external radiation. In this work, we derive an explicit formula for reproducing a sound field with minimal external radiation when a virtual source is located inside a loudspeaker array. The theory shows that external radiation can be effectively reduced without solving any inverse problem. The proposed formula follows the form of the KH integral and thus requires monopole and dipole sources. Although dipole sources are difficult to build in practice, the theory predicts that sound field reproduction with minimal external radiation is possible and that the room dependency of the sound field reproduction system can be decreased.},

A new fabrication process was used to manufacture a 26.3 mm by 26.3 mm array using five lithography steps. The array includes an integrated apodization, presented in detail in Part I of this paper, which is designed to reduce the amplitude of the ghost echoes that are otherwise prominent for row-column-addressed arrays. Custom front-end electronics were produced with the capability of transmitting and receiving on all elements, and the option of disabling the integrated apodization. The center frequency and -6-dB fractional bandwidth of the array elements were 2.77 ± 0.26 MHz and 102 ± 10\%, respectively. The surface transmit pressure at 2.5 MHz was 590 ± 73 kPa, and the sensitivity was 0.299 ± 0.090 V/Pa. The nearest neighbor crosstalk level was -23.9 ± 3.7 dB, while the transmit-to-receive-elements crosstalk level was -40.2 ± 3.5 dB. Imaging of a 0.3-mm-diameter steel wire using synthetic transmit focusing with 62 single-element emissions demonstrated axial and lateral FWHMs of 0.71 mm and 1.79 mm (f-number: 1.4), respectively, compared with simulated axial and lateral FWHMs of 0.69 mm and 1.76 mm. The dominant ghost echo was reduced by 15.8 dB in measurements using the integrated apodization compared with the disabled configuration. The effect was reproduced in simulations, showing a ghost echo reduction of 18.9 dB.},

Although fundamentals of ANC theory and principles of ANC methods have been well-established over the past 40 years, applications of this technology are facing new challenges. A larger quiet zone with better noise reduction performance is always desirable in a variety of real-life scenarios. This paper presents several important factors that affect the performance of multichannel ANC systems in some popular applications such as windows with natural ventilation and quiet-zone around heads. The factors affecting acoustic design include the reflection of a baffle plate, arrangement of error sensors in open areas, and so on. In addition, different control strategies are compared and analyzed, including centralized, decentralized, and distributed strategies. All these strategies are discussed from the signal processing side, which should be considered after a proper acoustic design. One of the important aims of this paper is to provide practical guidance for acoustic design and discuss several typical control strategies for multichannel ANC systems.},

  abstract = {The behavior of semiflexible chains modeling wormlike polymers such as DNA and actin in confined spaces was explored by coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. The persistence length P, mean end-to-end distance R2, mean radius of gyration Rg2, and the size ratio R2/Rg2 were computed for chains in slits, cylinders, and spheres. It was found that the intrinsic persistence length of a free chain undergoes on confinement substantial alteration into the apparent persistence length. The qualitative differences were found in trends of the apparent persistence lengths between slits and cylinders on one side and spheres on the other side. The quantities P, R2, Rg2, and R2/Rg2 display similar dependences upon squeezing the chains in nanopores. The above quantities change nonmonotonically with confinement in slits and cylinders, whereas they drop smoothly with decreasing radius of a sphere. For elongation of a chain in a cylinder, two regimes corresponding to strong and moderate confinements were found and compared to experiments and predictions of the blob and Odijk theories. In a spherical cavity, the toroidal chain structure with a hole in the center was detected under strong confinements. The scattering form factor S(q) computed for semiflexible confined chains revealed three regimes of behavior in a slit and a cylinder that matched up well with the scaling theory. The complex form of the function S(q) computed for a sphere was interpreted as a sign of the toroidal structure. A reasonable agreement was found between the simulations and measurements of DNA and actin filaments, confined in nano- and microfluidic channels and spherical droplets, pertaining to the changes of the persistence lengths, chain elongation, and toroidal structure formation.},

  abstract = {Light scattering from a particle that can be sectioned into circular slices is calculated by performing a coherent integration of the internal field over the volume of the target. The internal field in each slice is taken to be the internal-field solution of an infinite cylinder of radius equal to the radius of the slice. It is shown that for a spherical scatterer with size parameters up to 1.4, the integration leads to results that are in good agreement with those predicted by the Mie theory. Thus, we show the remarkable result that the internal field from an infinite cylinder can reproduce scattering intensities for such a radically different shape as a sphere. This being the case, a wide variety of target shapes between a sphere and a cylinder should be open to evaluation by this technique. The approach also has the benefit of being computationally efficient, requiring a double integration of the internal field over a disk and then coherently adding these calculations. The computations demonstrated in this paper are performed relatively quickly on a computer such as the Macintosh Centris 650, and this efficiency allows us to obtain the scattered fields for many target shapes.}

  abstract = {The standard technique used by commercial medical ultrasound systems to form B-mode images is delay and sum (DAS) beamforming. However, DAS often results in limited image resolution and contrast that are governed by the center frequency and the aperture size of the ultrasound transducer. A large number of elements lead to improved resolution but at the same time increase the data size and the system cost due to the receive electronics required for each element. Therefore, reducing the number of receiving channels while producing high-quality images is of great importance. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear beamformer called COnvolutional Beamforming Algorithm (COBA), which achieves significant improvement of lateral resolution and contrast. In addition, it can be implemented efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. Based on the COBA concept, we next present two sparse beamformers with closed-form expressions for the sensor locations, which result in the same beam pattern as DAS and COBA while using far fewer array elements. Optimization of the number of elements shows that they require a minimal number of elements that are on the order of the square root of the number used by DAS. The performance of the proposed methods is tested and validated using simulated data, phantom scans, and in vivo cardiac data. The results demonstrate that COBA outperforms DAS in terms of resolution and contrast and that the suggested beamformers offer a sizable element reduction while generating images with an equivalent or improved quality in comparison with DAS.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for learning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective. In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of wind turbine noise propagation over long distances requires modeling the dominant broadband aerodynamic noise sources, as well as the main outdoor sound propagation effects. In this study, two methods are compared to include extended aeroacoustic source models in a parabolic equation (PE) code for wind turbine noise propagation in an inhomogeneous atmosphere. In the first method, an initial starter is obtained for each segment of the blade using the backpropagation approach. In the second method, the blade segments are viewed as moving monopole sources, and only a limited number of PE simulations are needed for different source heights across the rotor plane. The two methods are compared to the point source approximation first in a homogeneous medium for validation purposes, and then in a stratified inhomogeneous atmosphere. The results show that an extended source model is necessary to calculate the sound pressure level upwind, where a shadow zone is present, and obtain the correct amplitude modulation levels. Furthermore, the second method is seen to yield as accurate results as the first method when a sufficient number of source heights is considered with a computation time that is much reduced.},

  abstract = {Various scalar equations are proposed, modeling the pressure field in the linear and nonlinear acoustical regimes. They are derived by assuming a flow with a small Mach number and a smaller medium heterogeneity. Such assumptions are well satisfied in the atmospheric boundary layer. Further simplifications can be obtained when less intense turbulent fluctuations are superimposed to a sheared mean flow. In the linear regime, a hierarchy of equations with increasing orders of precision is established. A new equation is found where all terms quadratic with respect to the ambient flow are retained, either related to sound convection by the flow, or to the flow inhomogeneity. Numerical solutions indicate that it is more precise than the equations in the literature for small Mach numbers, but less robust for larger negative Mach numbers. Two generalizations of Lilley’s equation incorporate the effects of turbulent fluctuations. Nonlinear terms are of different origins, either thermodynamical, inertial, or related to the flow shear. For a locally plane wave, they simplify into a single term which appears as the classical Westervelt quadratic nonlinearity convected by the flow. Consequently, all linear equations can easily be generalized to nonlinear ones, such as a new Lilley’s equation augmented with acoustical nonlinearities and turbulent flow fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Broadband beamforming applied to superdirective arrays is known to be highly sensitive to transducers characteristics errors. Recently, an effective method to synthesize a robust, broadband, data-independent, filter-and-sum beamformer, which considers the probability distributions of errors, has been proposed. It considers an array with arbitrary lay-out and provides a spatial directivity pattern close to the desired one. Unfortunately, the evaluation of the cost function requires a computational load and an amount of memory that increases very quickly with the transducers and the filter coefficients. As the synthesis process requires an iterative minimization, it may become unacceptably long. In this paper, an alternative procedure for evaluating the same cost function is presented, drastically reducing such problems and without introducing any approximation. The only additional constraint is on the antenna which must be an equally-spaced linear array. This procedure makes it much easier to apply the above-mentioned synthesis method to a wide panorama of practical situations.},

  abstract = {Planar arrays are used jointly with filter-and-sum beamforming to achieve 3-D spatial discrimination in processing broadband signals. In these systems, the beams are steered in various directions to investigate a given portion of space. The band can be so wide as to require both superdirective performance (to increase directivity at low frequencies) and sparse aperiodic layouts (to avoid grating lobes at high frequencies). We propose an original method to simultaneously optimize the transducer positions and the coefficients of the Finite Impulse Response FIR filters, providing a solution that maintains its validity for whatever steering direction inside a predefined region of interest. A hybrid strategy, analytical for the coefficients and stochastic for the positions, is devised to minimize the beam pattern (BP) energy while maintaining an unaltered signal from the steering direction and controlling the side lobes. The robustness of the superdirectivity is achieved by taking into account the probability density functions for the characteristics of realistic transducers. A distinctive feature of our method is its ability to maintain the computational tractability of the addressed optimization problem by drastically reducing the burden of evaluating the cost function. The obtained results, addressing tens of transducers and several octaves of band, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of directivity, contrast, and robustness.},

  abstract = {When performing binaural spatialisation, it is widely accepted that the choice of the head related transfer functions (HRTFs), and in particular the use of individually measured ones, can have an impact on localisation accuracy, externalization, and overall realism. Yet the impact of HRTF choices on speech-in-noise performances in cocktail party-like scenarios has not been investigated in depth. This paper introduces a study where 22 participants were presented with a frontal speech target and two lateral maskers, spatialised using a set of non-individual HRTFs. Speech reception threshold (SRT) was measured for each HRTF. Furthermore, using the SRT predicted by an existing speech perception model, the measured values were compensated in the attempt to remove overall HRTF-specific benefits. Results show significant overall differences among the SRTs measured using different HRTFs, consistently with the results predicted by the model. Individual differences between participants related to their SRT performances using different HRTFs could also be found, but their significance was reduced after the compensation. The implications of these findings are relevant to several research areas related to spatial hearing and speech perception, suggesting that when testing speech-in-noise performances within binaurally rendered virtual environments, the choice of the HRTF for each individual should be carefully considered.},

The aim is to reproduce a main lobe profile as close as possible to the desired one through the synthesis of the array-weighting window. A typical goal is to obtain, in wide-band conditions, a flat-top shaped beam similar to the ones produced by specific narrow-band windows. To achieve this result, an optimization process based on simulated annealing is developed and applied under different operating conditions, including two wide-band beam pattern definitions and different values of the fractional bandwidth. Although the shape of the resulting main lobe is not as good as the one obtained in narrow-band conditions (the reasons for this drawback are given), it is shown that the adoption of windows synthesized by the proposed method is more suitable than the direct application of narrow-band windows in wide-band conditions. In addition to providing better performances, it is shown that the windows synthesized by the proposed method also result in greater robustness to random perturbations of weight values, which are unavoidable in real systems.},

  abstract = {The degradation of ultrasonic image quality is typically attributed to aberration and reverberation. Although the sources and impact of aberration are well understood, very little is known about the source and impact of image degradation caused by reverberation. Reverberation is typically associated with multiple reflections at two interfaces along the same propagation path, as with the arterial wall or a metal sphere. However, the reverberation that results in image degradation includes more complex interaction between the propagating wave and the tissue. Simulations of wave propagation in realistic and simplified models of the abdominal wall are used to illustrate the characteristics of coherent and diffuse clutter generated by reverberation. In the realistic models, diffuse reverberation clutter is divided into that originating from the tissue interfaces and that originating from sub-resolution diffuse scatterers. In the simplified models, the magnitude of the reverberation clutter is observed as angle and density of the connective tissue are altered. The results suggest that multi-path scattering from the connective tissue/fat interfaces is a dominant component of reverberation clutter. Diffuse reverberation clutter is maximal when the connective tissue is near normal to the beam direction and increases with the density of connective tissue layers at these large angles. The presence of a thick fascial or fibrous layer at the distal boundary of the abdominal wall magnifies the amount of reverberation clutter. The simulations also illustrate that compression of the abdominal layer, a technique often used to mitigate clutter in overweight and obese patients, increases the decay of reverberation clutter with depth. In addition, rotation of the transducer or steering of the beam with respect to highly reflecting boundaries can reduce coherent clutter and transform it to diffuse clutter, which can be further reduced using coherence-based beamforming techniques. In vivo images of the human bladder illustrate some of the reverberation effects observed in simulation.},

Two expansions are together inserted in this integral, which is then expressible in terms of the simple algebraic functions. The approach is useful in treatment of the field radiation problem for a large and important group of piston sources in acoustics. As examples, the calculation results for the uniform and the simply supported piston sources are presented, in a good agreement with those evaluated by numerical integration.},

The new model, CISM, was developed on the basis of the sound propagation predictions of the Ondet and Barbry RAYCUB model in laboratory and industrial spaces. CISM uses an optimum representation, based on the accuracy of the RAYCUB results, so that the prediction accuracy is maintained while run-time and data input requirements are reduced. The basis of CISM is described, and predictions for various configurations of a fitted laboratory space, an empty factory incorporating a single barrier and a theoretical space with absorptive patches are presented. For comparison, sound propagation measurements were obtained and RAYCUB derived models, RAYCUB-DIR and RAYCUB-DIR REDIR, were used to predict these sound levels. This work demonstrated that the CISM model is as accurate as the ray-tracing model RAYCUB in the described enclosed spaces. The advantages of the CISM model are a reduced run-time (for a typical factory, CISM is approximately ten times faster than RAYCUB-DIR) and reduced data input (CISM uses less than half the information required by RAYCUB-DIR).},

Recently, mechanical topological insulators have sought to overcome this challenge by supporting back-scattering resistant wave transmission. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable electroacoustic topological insulator exhibiting an analog to the quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE). Using programmable switches, this phononic structure allows for rapid reconfiguration of domain walls and thus the ability to control back-scattering resistant wave propagation along dynamic interfaces for phonons lying in static and finite-frequency regimes. Accordingly, a graphene-like polyactic acid (PLA) layer serves as the host medium, equipped with periodically arranged and bonded piezoelectric (PZT) patches, resulting in two Dirac cones at the K points. The PZT patches are then connected to negative capacitance external circuits to break inversion symmetry and create nontrivial topologically protected bandgaps. As such, topologically protected interface waves are demonstrated numerically and validated experimentally for different predefined trajectories over a broad frequency range.},

Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a phononic crystal Floquet TI (FTI). Hexagonal arrays of circular piezoelectric disks bonded to a PLA substrate, shunted through negative electrical capacitance, and manipulated by external integrated circuits, provide the required spatiotemporal modulation scheme to break time-reversal symmetry and impart a synthetic angular momentum bias that can induce strong topological protection on the lattice edges. Our proposed reconfigurable FTI may find applications for robust acoustic emitters and mechanical logic circuits, with distinct advantages over electronic equivalents in harsh operating conditions.},

  abstract = {For pt.I see ibid., vol.14, p.973(1988). Products of Green functions for pion-nucleon interactions can most naturally be evaluated by transformation to a momentum-space representation. Such transformations often involve an integral whose integrand is highly oscillatory. By deforming the contour of integration in the complex plane, such an integral can be made to converge rapidly. All oscillatory terms are converted into pure damping terms which decrease exponentially. Examples are given for simple integrals, for the integral of three spherical Bessel functions, and for the Fourier and spherical Bessel function transforms of the Woods-Saxon potential (Fermi-Dirac distribution function). They authors also show that oscillatory principal-value integrals can usually be accurately evaluated using this method. Convergence with respect to the number of Gaussian points is studied. It is shown that the method normally converges much better than ordinary integration along the real axis, especially as the frequency of the oscillations increases relative to the damping. A comparison is made with the method of steepest descent.},

When high-order Zernike moments are computed, both computing speed and numerical accuracy become inferior. The main purpose of this study is to propose a stable, fast method for computing high-order Zernike moments. Based on the recursive formulas for computing Zernike radial polynomials, this study develops stable, fast algorithms to compute Zernike moments. Symmetry under group action and Farey sequence are both applied to shorten the computing time. The experimental results show that the proposed method took 5.292 seconds to compute the top 500-order Zernike moments of an image with 512×512 pixels. The normalized mean square error is 0.00124846 if 450-order moments are used to reconstruct the image. When computing the high-order Zernike moments, the proposed method outperformed other compared methods in terms of speed and accuracy.},

That results in remarkable properties like the reduction of plate vibrations, the potential for energy harvesting thanks to the focalization of energy, or the design of new metamaterials to manipulate acoustics waves. The analysis of such phenomena demands simulating the modal shapes and response to external excitations of ABH plates. This is usually done by means of numerical approaches, like the finite element method (FEM). However, if one is interested in performing long parametric analyses and in capturing the ABH plate behavior at high frequencies, the computational cost associated to numerical methods may become too demanding. In this work, a semi-analytical approach is suggested to circumvent the situation. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is applied using two-dimensional Gaussian functions to expand the flexural motion of a plate with non-uniform thickness. Then, a matrix-replacing strategy is proposed to embed the multiple ABHs in the plate. That results in low dimensional matrix systems, which yet provide very accurate solutions. After presenting all theoretical developments, the semi-analytical method is first applied to analyze the performance of a single ABH when varying several of its parameters. Then, various configurations involving multiple ABHs are considered. Those range from long strips exhibiting frequency attenuation bands, to plates containing ABH indentations in many shapes and sizes.},

  abstract = {Acoustic black hole (ABH) indentations have proven to be an efficient way for reducing vibrations on straight beams and plates. However, many built-up structures in the naval and aerospace sectors involve curved beams and shells, so there is a need to check whether the ABH effect could be also beneficial for them. To date, such issue has not been yet addressed and in this work some initial steps are proposed towards it. In particular, an analysis is made of the vibrational behavior of a circular beam with embedded ABHs. A semi-analytical model is suggested in the framework of the Rayleigh-Ritz method, making use of Gaussian trial functions. The key to the approach is building a basis of Gaussian functions that fulfill the periodic boundary conditions on the beam, to approximate its radial and tangential motions. It is shown how this can be done quite directly and efficiently. The validity of the proposed approach is then tested by comparison with finite element simulations, showing very good matching. The Gaussian expansion is then applied to study the dependence of the bending vibration of an ABH circular beam with frequency. After that, the influence of curvature and boundary conditions are established by comparing the performance of close and open circular ABH beams and straight periodic beams. Circular beams containing different number of ABHs are also studied and the appearance of frequency stopbands is reported.},

  abstract = {3D Zernike moments based on 3D Zernike polynomials have been successfully applied to the field of voxelized 3D shape retrieval and have attracted more attention in biomedical image processing. As the order of 3D Zernike moments increases, both computational efficiency and numerical accuracy decrease. Due to this phenomenon, a more efficient and stable method for computing high-order 3D Zernike moments was proposed in this study. The proposed recursive formula for computing 3D Zernike radial polynomials combines the recursive calculation of spherical harmonics to develop a voxel-based algorithm for the calculation of 3D Zernike moments. The algorithm was applied to the 3D shape Michelangelo's David with a size of 150×150×150 voxels. As compared to the method without additional acceleration, the proposed method uses a group action of order sixteen orthogonal group and saving unnecessary iterations, the factor of speed-up is 56.783±3.999 when the order of Zernike moments is between 10 and 450. The proposed method also obtained an accurate reconstructed shape with the error rate (normalized mean square error) of 0.00 (4.17×10\^-3) when the reconstruction was computed for all moments up to order 450.},

  abstract = {Building upon the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological phases of matter, disclinations have recently been harnessed to trap fractionally quantized density of states (DOS) in classical wave systems. While these fractional DOS have associated states localized to the disclination’s core, such states are not protected from deconfinement due to the breaking of chiral symmetry, generally leading to resonances which, even in principle, have finite lifetimes and suboptimal confinement. Here, we devise and experimentally validate in acoustic lattices a paradigm by which topological states bind to disclinations without a fractional DOS but which preserve chiral symmetry. The preservation of chiral symmetry pins the states at the midgap, resulting in their protected maximal confinement. The integer DOS at the defect results in twofold degenerate states that, due to symmetry constraints, do not gap out. Our study provides a fresh perspective about the interplay between symmetry protection in topological phases and topological defects, with possible applications in classical and quantum systems alike.},

In three dimensions, we furthermore establish the existence of: a flux spectral jump, where flux tube insertion fills up the entire point gap only at a single parallel crystal momentum; a higher-order flux skin effect, which occurs at the ends of flux tubes in presence of pseudo-inversion symmetry; and a flux Majorana mode that represents a spectrally isolated mid-gap state in the complex energy plane. We uniquely associate each non-Hermitian symmetry class with intrinsic point gap topology with one of these cases or a trivial flux response, and discuss possible experimental realizations.},

However, we show that the Z equation cannot be a scalar equation for the propagation of two-dimensional shear waves in general elastic materials (with strain energy depending on the first and second principal invariants of strain). Then, we introduce dispersive and dissipative terms to deduce the scalar Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP), Zabolotskaya–Khokhlov (ZK) and Khokhlov–Zabolotskaya–Kuznetsov (KZK) equations of incompressible solid mechanics.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: In 131I SPECT, image quality and quantification accuracy are degraded by object scatter as well as scatter and penetration in the collimator. The characterization of energy and spatial distributions of scatter and penetration performed in this study by Monte Carlo simulation will be useful for the development and evaluation of techniques that compensate for such events in 131I imaging. METHODS: First, to test the accuracy of the Monte Carlo model, simulated and measured data were compared for both a point source and a phantom. Next, simulations to investigate scatter and penetration were performed for four geometries: point source in air, point source in a water-filled cylinder, hot sphere in a cylinder filled with nonradioactive water, and hot sphere in a cylinder filled with radioactive water. Energy spectra were separated according to order of scatter, type of interaction, and gamma-ray emission energy. A preliminary evaluation of the triple-energy window (TEW) scatter correction method was performed. RESULTS: The accuracy of the Monte Carlo model was verified by the good agreement between measured and simulated energy spectra and radial point spread functions. For a point source in air, simulations show that 73\% of events in the photopeak window had either scattered in or penetrated the collimator, indicating the significance of collimator interactions. For a point source in a water-filled phantom, the separated energy spectra showed that a 20\% photopeak window can be used to eliminate events that scatter more than two times in the phantom. For the hot sphere phantoms, it was shown that in the photopeak region the spectrum shape of penetration events is very similar to that of primary (no scatter and no penetration) events. For the hot sphere regions of interest, the percentage difference between true scatter counts and the TEW estimate of scatter counts was {$<$}12\%. CONCLUSION: In 131I SPECT, object scatter as well as collimator scatter and penetration are significant. The TEW method provides a reasonable correction for scatter, but the similarity between the 364-keV primary and penetration energy spectra makes it difficult to compensate for these penetration events using techniques that are based on spectral analysis.},

In this study, we proposed a method to effectively assess the psPD from a mmWave antenna using its spherical near-field measurement data. This method employed the transformation of spherical wave expansion to plane wave expansion to reconstruct the electric and magnetic field components on an evaluation plane in front of the antenna aperture. The psPD was subsequently obtained based on the time-average Poynting vector. The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by comparing it with full-wave simulation results using 12 array antennas at frequencies ranging from 10 to 90 GHz. It was revealed that at 30 GHz, the reconstruction errors for psPD4cm2 were less than 0.8 dB and 0.2 dB on evaluation planes 2 and 5 mm, respectively, in front of the antennas. The robustness of the proposed method against the noise, scan range, and number of spherical modes were evaluated. The proposal may eliminate conventional compliance assessment procedures once antenna performance is evaluated in spherical near-field measurement.},

The results provided clear positive evidence for no effect of ultrasound exposure on performance in each task, whether measured in terms of participants’ ability to select the correct response or their reaction times when responding correctly. Participants were also not better than chance at stating when the ultrasound had been presented.

Dose equivalent values are computed as the sum of two contributions, the dose equivalent when the sphere is in vacuo and the dose equivalent from scattered photons and the corresponding electrons and positrons produced in an air column in front of the sphere. The dimensions of the air cylinder required to attain full electronic equilibrium were derived for each photon energy. The calculation of absorbed dose to air in air is described. Dose equivalents at 300 and 1000 mg cm-2 depths, the restricted dose equivalent indices, the average dose equivalent in the sphere as well as depth-dose equivalent and angle-dose equivalent distributions are presented, normalised both to fluence and absorbed dose to air.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermitian systems distinguish themselves from Hermitian systems by exhibiting a phase transition point called an exceptional point (EP), at which two eigenstates coalesce under a system parameter variation. Many interesting EP phenomena, such as level crossings in nuclear and condensed matter physics, and unusual phenomena in optics, such as loss-induced lasing and unidirectional transmission, can be understood by considering a simple 2×2 non-Hermitian matrix. At a higher dimension, more complex EP physics not found in two-state systems arises. We consider the emergence and interaction of multiple EPs in a four-state system theoretically and realize the system experimentally using four coupled acoustic cavities with asymmetric losses. We find that multiple EPs can emerge, and as the system parameters vary, these EPs can collide and merge, leading to higher-order singularities and topological characteristics much richer than those seen in two-state systems. The new physics obtained is not limited to the acoustic systems demonstrated here. It also applies to other systems as well, such as coupled photonic cavities and waveguides.},

Although inertial amplification is a terrific candidate for addressing the barrier, numerous extended ideas are limited to the classical models, thus, slowing or stalling the advances in this demand. To break this limit, we report a kind of planar chiral phononic crystal based on Thomson scattering. Different from the optimization effect produced in the locally resonant phononic crystals, the mirrored chirality can open a Thomson scattering-induced broad bandgap when the local resonant sub-structure is discarded. In addition, while simplifying the material components, we lower the starting frequency of the bandgap with a virtually unchanged width for the same lattice constant, stiffness and mass. Consequently, the starting frequency of the attenuation can be in the same order of magnitude as the local resonance bandgap, while the width is significantly better than the latter. Our proposal may open a new way to manipulate broadband elastic waves and validate that Thomson scattering is a promising alternative approach and mechanism for bandgap formation.},

The developed solution is formulated as a Wiener filter, by deriving an iterative version exhibiting better performance features, especially in more challenging scenarios (e.g., limited amount of data and/or noisy conditions). Simulation results obtained in the context of echo cancellation indicate the appealing features of the proposed solution.},

  abstract = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have received significant attention for their ability to enhance light-matter interactions across a wide range of systems, including lasers, sensors, and frequency mixers. However, many applications require degenerate or nearly degenerate high-quality factor (Q) modes, such as spontaneous parametric down conversion, non-linear four-wave mixing, and intra-cavity difference frequency~mixing~for terahertz generation. Previously, degenerate pairs of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been created by fine-tuning the structure to engineer the degeneracy, yielding BICs that respond unpredictably to structure imperfections and material variations. Instead, using a group theoretic approach, we present a design paradigm based on six-fold rotational symmetry (C6) for creating degenerate pairs of symmetry-protected BICs, whose frequency splitting and Q-factors can be independently and predictably controlled, yielding a complete design phase space. Using a combination of resonator and lattice deformations in silicon metasurfaces, we experimentally demonstrate the ability to tune mode spacing from 2 nm to 110 nm while simultaneously controlling Q-factor.},

  abstract = {声学黑洞(Acoustic Black Hole)结构简称ABH，是一种新兴的，较为高效的减振降噪结构，其精巧的结构形式可实现对弹性波的有效吸收，其正有望取代传统大面积贴附阻尼层的减振降噪的方式。理想的一维ABH结构是基于基本平滑假设的幂律式楔形结构，波传递到二次以上的幂律结构时不发生反射，但在实际工程中，ABH结构因加工精度等因素不可避免地存在截断，在截断处必然发生波的反射。为衡量ABH结构减振降噪的性能，ABH结构的反射系数成为重要评价指标。目前求解声学黑洞反射系数的方法，在理论上主要有几何声学法和阻抗法，但几何声学法大都被应用于单次求解来验证实验结果，缺少通用的数学模型以及对反射系数变化规律的总结，且依赖于基本平滑假设，结果不完全准确。阻抗法虽然不依靠基本平滑假设，但因算法复杂，缺乏准确已实现的算法和算例。　　为实现利用几何声学法总结出基于ABH反射系数变化规律，首先需增加几何声学法的可实现性，本文将龙贝格法和几何声学法相结合，实现对声学黑洞反射系数的快速求解。基于本方法所编写的软件，可实现输入任意参数均可求出声学黑洞的反射系数曲线。在此基础上，分析了各参数对声学黑洞反射系数的影响，确定出稳定长度及稳定阻尼层厚度随ABH结构几何参数的变化规律。最终得到声学黑洞的性质，这些性质对声学黑洞的优化设计能起到指导性作用。　　本文针对阻抗法中复变多元微分方程的求解困难的问题，结合龙格库塔法和平滑曲线方法对反射系数进行求解，得出一条与几何声学法处于同一量级的曲线。又针对龙格库塔法(RKF4-5)显式方法稳定性不足的特点，结合了费尔伯格自适应思想，高斯隐式方法，拓展了RKFGI4-6隐式算法，使程序能自动进行多次迭代求解隐式非线性方程。本方法在一定程度上增加了阻抗的计算精度，并通过龙格库塔法(RK)与平滑方法结合，消除振荡，获得了更加准确的ABH结构的反射系数的曲线。　　ABH结构的末端尺寸偏薄，极易变形，而提升ABH结构的总体厚度又会使反射系数急剧上升，以至于ABH结构失效。因此，难以找到既可以机械加工，又能使反射系数达到吸振效果的ABH结构。本文以提高ABH结构的加工可行性为目的，结合机械加工以及由几何声学法得到的程序和规律，来寻求既能得到良好的可加工性，又不过大影响反射系数的方法，并获得了两种可行性较高的改进方案。},

  abstract = {Reproducing zones of personal sound is a challenging signal processing problem that has garnered considerable research interest in recent years. We introduce in this work an extended method to multizone soundfield reproduction that overcomes issues with speech privacy and quality. Measures of speech intelligibility contrast (SIC) and speech quality are used as cost functions in an optimization of speech privacy and quality. Novel spatial and (temporal) frequency domain speech masker filter designs are proposed to accompany the optimization process. Spatial masking filters are designed using multizone soundfield algorithms that are dependent on the target speech multizone reproduction. Combinations of estimates of acoustic contrast and long term average speech spectra are proposed to provide equal masking influence on speech privacy and quality. Spatial aliasing specific to multizone soundfield reproduction geometry is further considered in analytically derived low-pass filters. Simulated and real-world experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method using semi-circular and linear loudspeaker arrays. Simulated implementations of the proposed method show that significant SIC and speech quality is achievable between zones. A range of perceptual evaluation of speech quality mean opinion scores that indicate good quality are obtained while at the same time providing confidential privacy as indicated by SIC. The simulations also show that the method is robust to variations in the speech, virtual source location, array geometry, and number of loudspeakers. Real-world experiments confirm the practicality of the proposed methods by showing that good quality and confidential privacy are achievable.},

  abstract = {Small angle neutron scattering of both activated and deactivated hexadecameric ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from spinach revealed that its structure in solution very closely resembles that determined for the deactivated crystalline enzyme from tobacco (Baker, T.S., Eisenberg, D., and Eiserling, F. (1977) Science 196, 293-295). Scattering from both forms of the enzyme in H2O most closely fits that expected from a hollow sphere with an outer radius of 56.4 A and inner radius of 14.3 A. In D2O the enzyme's scattering profiles more closely resembled those of a hollow cylinder with an axial ratio of approximately 1.06 and outer and inner radii of 46.7 and 12.9 A, respectively. Superpositioning of model structures showed that both models determined by neutron scattering correspond quite well to that inferred from x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy of the tobacco enzyme. Sedimentation velocity studies confirmed that no major conformational change occurs upon activation of the spinch carboxylase, both forms exhibiting a sedimentation coefficient, 8(20,w), of 17.8 S. Neutron scattering by activated and deactivated carboxylase from Rhodospirillum rubrum, a dimeric enzyme, best matched that predicted for a solid prolate ellipsoid or cylinder. The estimated dimensions of the model structures correspond strikingly well to those predicted for adjacent pairs of large subunits in the hexadecameric tobacco enzyme.},

  abstract = {The current work aims at developing a linearized Euler equations solver in curvilinear coordinates to account for the effects of topography on sound propagation. In applications for transportation noise, the propagation environment as well as the description of acoustic sources is complex, and time-domain methods have proved their capability to deal with both atmospheric and ground effects. First, equations in curvilinear coordinates are examined. Then time-domain boundary conditions initially proposed for a Cartesian coordinate system are implemented in the curvilinear solver. Two test cases dealing with acoustic scattering by an impedance cylinder in a two-dimensional geometry and by an impedance sphere in a three-dimensional geometry are considered to validate the boundary conditions. Accurate solutions are obtained for both rigid and impedance surfaces. Finally, the solver is used to examine a typical outdoor sound propagation problem. It is shown that it is well-suited to study coupled effects of topography, mixed impedance ground and meteorological conditions.}

In this context, propagated signals are composed of few modal components, each of them propagating according to its own wavenumber. Frequency-wavenumber (f-k) representations are classical methods allowing modal separation. However, they require large horizontal line sensor arrays aligned with the source. In this paper, to reduce the number of sensors, a sparse model is proposed and combined with prior knowledge on the wavenumber physics. The method resorts to a state-of-the-art Bayesian algorithm exploiting a Bernoulli-Gaussian model. The latter, well suited to the sparse representations, makes possible a natural integration of prior information through a wise choice of the Bernoulli parameters. The performance of the method is quantified on simulated data and finally assessed through a successful application on real data.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of efficient computation of the spherical harmonic expansion, or Fourier transform, of functions defined on the two dimensional sphere, S2. The resulting algorithms are applied to the efficient computation of convolutions of functions on the sphere. We begin by proving convolution theorems generalizing well known and useful results from the abelian case. These convolution theorems are then used to develop a sampling theorem on the sphere. which reduces the calculation of Fourier transforms and convolutions of band-limited functions to discrete computations. We show how to perform these efficiently, starting with an O(n(log n)2) time algorithm for computing the Legendre transform of a function defined on the interval [−1,1] sampled at n points there. Theoretical and experimental results on the effects of finite precision arithmetic are presented. The Legendre transform algorithm is then generalized to obtain an algorithm for the Fourier transform, requiring O(n(log n)2) time, and an algorithm for its inverse in O(n1.5) time, where n is the number of points on the sphere at which the function is sampled. This improves the naive O(n2) bound, which is the best previously known. These transforms give an O(n1.5) algorithm for convolving two functions on the sphere.},

To achieve more applications, we further construct two well-designed structures involving this lattice, namely a heterostructure and a sandwich structure. An optical diode can be realized using the heterostructure, while tunable light trapping and reversal can be realized through phase modulations on the sandwich structure. The results in this paper may not only open up a new path for unconventional light transport but also have potential applications for optical communication.},

Unlike the conventional topological insulators that demand bulk gap closings at transition points, the higher-order band topology can be changed without bulk closure and exhibits as an obstruction of higher-dimensional boundary states. Here, we report the first experimental realization of three-dimensional surface-obstructed topological insulators with using acoustic crystals. Our acoustic measurements demonstrate unambiguously the emergence of one-dimensional topological hinge states in the middle of the bulk and surface band gaps, as a direct manifestation of the higher-order band topology. Together with comparative measurements for the trivial and phase-transition-point insulators, our experimental data conclusively evidence the unique bulk-boundary physics for the surface-obstructed band topology. That is, the topological phase transition is determined by the closure of the surface gap, rather than by closing the bulk gap. Our study might spur on new activities to deepen the understanding of such elusive topological phases.},

  abstract = {String vibration represents an active field of research in acoustics. Small-amplitude vibration is often assumed, leading to simplified physical models that can be simulated efficiently. However, the inclusion of nonlinear phenomena due to larger string stretchings is necessary to capture important features, and efficient numerical algorithms are currently lacking in this context. Of the available techniques, many lead to schemes which may only be solved iteratively, resulting in high computational cost, and the additional concerns of existence and uniqueness of solutions. Slow and fast waves are present concurrently in the transverse and longitudinal directions of motion, adding further complications concerning numerical dispersion. This work presents a linearly-implicit scheme for the simulation of the geometrically exact nonlinear string model. The scheme conserves a numerical energy, expressed as the sum of quadratic terms only, and including an auxiliary state variable yielding the nonlinear effects. This scheme allows to treat the transverse and longitudinal waves separately, using a mixed finite difference/modal scheme for the two directions of motion. A matrix decomposition algorithm is presented, so to treat the sparse and full parts of the update matrix separately. Numerical experiments are presented throughout.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic cavities are used in numerous domains of applied and fundamental physics, from microwave ovens and electromagnetic compatibility to masers, quantum electrodynamics (QED), and quantum chaos. The wave fields established in cavities are statically fixed by their geometry, which are usually modified by using mechanical parts like mode stirrers in reverberation chambers or screws in masers and QED. Nevertheless, thanks to integral theorems, tailoring the cavity boundaries theoretically permits us to design at will the wave fields they support. Here, we show in the microwave domain that it is achievable dynamically simply by using electronically tunable metasurfaces that locally modify the boundaries, switching them in real time from Dirichlet to Neumann conditions. We prove that at a high modal density, counterintuitively, it permits us to create wave patterns presenting hot spots of intense energy. We explain and model the physical mechanism underlying the concept, which allows us to find a criterion ensuring that modifying parts of a cavity’s boundaries turn it into a completely different one. We finally prove that this approach even permits us, in the limiting case where the cavity supports only well-separated resonances, to choose the frequencies at which the latter occur.},

  abstract = {Reverberation in rooms is often simulated with the image method due to Allen and Berkley (1979). This method has an asymptotic complexity that is cubic in terms of the simulated reverberation length. When employed in the frequency domain, it is relatively computationally expensive if there are many receivers in the room or if the source or receiver positions are changing with time. The computational complexity of the image method is due to the repeated summation of the fields generated by a large number of image sources. In this paper, a fast method to perform such summations is presented. The method is based on multipole expansion of the monopole source potential. For offline computation of the room transfer function for N image sources and M receiver points, use of the Allen-Berkley algorithm requires O(NM) operations, whereas use of the proposed method requires only O(N+M) operations, resulting in significantly faster computation of reverberant sound fields. The proposed method also has a considerable speed advantage in situations where the room transfer function must be rapidly updated online in response to source/receiver location changes. Simulation results are presented, and algorithm accuracy, speed, and implementation details are discussed. For problems that require frequency-domain computations, the algorithm is found to generate sound fields identical to the ones obtained with the frequency-domain version of the Allen-Berkley algorithm at a fraction of computational cost},

This paper will describe a helical wave, a type of wave that transmits phase information across a section of the plane linearly about the azimuth. The wave will be described from the ground up. First, a circular baffled transducer pressure field will be derived. Next, the field generated using two crossed circular transducers will be derived and approximations given for the far field. The general expression for the acoustic field from this arrangement is derived in the far field utilizing a paraxial ray approximation for ideal sources but applied to the more complex conceptualization of the monopole source being given by the circular piston source. In addition, the work presented was investigated numerically in comparison to a different approximation made in the field dependence on monopole separation of the two sources making up the dipole. Next, numerical examination of two crossed dipoles is examined with visualizations of the pressure and discussion of transients created when the direction of spiral changes. Finally, there is a discussion for the detection and estimation of helical waves and potential uses.},

The configuration of these metamaterials typically limits the propagation of the wave to a single direction, speed, or occurrence with little or no tunability. Here we present—theoretically, numerically, and experimentally—a simple design approach for reprogrammable metamaterials, which allows for all of these parameters to be tuned, enabled, disabled, or reset. We present a map of different geometries that allow for reciprocal and nonreciprocal wave propagation and attenuation. We show how a single design can be programmed on demand to support wave propagation and attenuation in both directions (reciprocal) or wave propagation in only one direction (nonreciprocal). In addition, we demonstrate real-time control of the wave velocity, both in amplitude and direction, as it propagates through the metamaterial. We show speeding up, slowing down, or complete reversal of the propagating wave direction. Furthermore, we show that the waves maintain a constant velocity regardless of the impulse magnitude, and even along a curved path. Our metamaterial could open exciting possibilities for designing nonlinear materials with exotic topological properties.},

Our method utilizes direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR) control of room impulse responses and in-head localization based on interaural level difference (ILD) control with a virtual headphone. For distance control between the listener and the remote loudspeakers, we employ the DRR based on the amplitude panning for surround PALs and EDLs. For distance control centered on the listener, we use ILD control based on amplitude panning for the virtual headphones using surround PALs. Additionally, the type of control used is switched at a certain boundary distance, and gain coefficients are calculated for the positions and times of the moving sound images to achieve effective virtual sound source rendering. We also report on the results of evaluation experiments conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation of targets improves with the number of elements employed by a phased array radar antenna. Since larger arrays have high associated cost, area and computational load, there is a recent interest in thinning the antenna arrays without loss of far-field DoA accuracy. In this context, a cognitive radar may deploy a full array and then select an optimal subarray to transmit and receive the signals in response to changes in the target environment. Prior works have used optimisation and greedy search methods to pick the best subarrays cognitively. In this study, deep learning is leveraged to address the antenna selection problem. Specifically, they construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a multi-class classification framework, where each class designates a different subarray. The proposed network determines a new array every time data is received by the radar, thereby making antenna selection a cognitive operation. Their numerical experiments show that the proposed CNN structure provides 22\% better classification performance than a support vector machine and the resulting subarrays yield 72\% more accurate DoA estimates than random array selections.},

Moreover, in a cognitive radar system, the sparse subarrays are chosen based on the target scenario at that instant. Recently, a deep-learning based antenna selection technique was proposed for a single target scenario. In this paper, we extend this approach to multiple targets and assess the performance of state-of-the-art direction of arrival estimation techniques in conjunction with the proposed antenna selection method. To optimally choose the subarrays based on the target DOAs, we design a convolutional neural network which accepts the array covariance matrix as an input and selects the best sparse subarray that minimizes the error. Once the optimum sparse subarray is obtained, the signals from the selected antennas are used to estimate the DOAs. We provide numerical simulations to validate the performance of the proposed cognitive array selection strategy. We show that the proposed approach outperforms random sparse antenna selection and it leads to a higher DOA estimation accuracy by 6 dB.},

Recent research shows that computational complexity of array selection is reduced by replacing the conventional optimization and greedy search methods with a deep learning network. However, in practice, sufficient and well-calibrated labeled training data are unavailable and, more so, for arbitrary array configurations. To address this, we adopt a deep transfer learning (TL) approach, wherein we train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with data of a source sensor array for which calibrated data are readily available and reuse this pre-trained CNN for a different, data-insufficient target array geometry to perform sparse array selection. Numerical experiments with uniform rectangular and circular arrays demonstrate enhanced performance of TL-CNN on the target model than the CNN trained with insufficient data from the same model. In particular, our TL framework provides approximately 20\% higher sensor selection accuracy and 10\% improvement in the direction-of-arrival estimation error.},

To date, these beams have been generated only by using linear diffractive elements. Here, we show a new way of generating Airy beams by using three-wave mixing processes, which occur in asymmetric nonlinear photonic crystals. We experimentally generated a second-harmonic Airy beam and examined the tuning properties of the nonlinear interaction and propagation dynamics of the pump and second-harmonic output beams. This nonlinear generation process enables Airy beams to be obtained at new wavelengths, and opens up new possibilities for all-optical switching and manipulation of Airy beams.},

  abstract = {Active control of the sound power scattered by a sphere is theoretically investigated using spherical harmonic expansions of the primary and secondary fields. The sphere has a surface impedance that is uniform, real, and locally reacting while being subjected to an incident monochromatic plane wave. The scattered power is controlled with a number of monopole sources, initially on the surface of the sphere, and is expressed as the sum of squared amplitudes of the spherical harmonics due to both the scattered and control fields. This quadratic function is minimized to identify the optimal strengths for different numbers of control sources. At low frequencies, the scattered field is dominated by the first few spherical harmonic terms, and its power can be significantly reduced with a single controlling monopole for a soft or absorbent sphere and with two monopoles for a hard sphere. The number of secondary sources required to significantly attenuate the scattered field at higher frequencies is found to be proportional to the square of the frequency, and the attenuation also falls off rapidly if the secondary sources are moved away from the surface of the sphere, no matter what its surface impedance.},

  abstract = {Characterizing sound field diffuseness has many practical applications, from room acoustics analysis to speech enhancement and sound field reproduction. In this paper, we investigate how spherical microphone arrays (SMAs) can be used to characterize diffuseness. Due to their specific geometry, SMAs are particularly well suited for analyzing the spatial properties of sound fields. In particular, the signals recorded by an SMA can be analyzed in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, which has special and desirable mathematical properties when it comes to analyzing diffuse sound fields. We present a new measure of diffuseness, the COMEDIE diffuseness estimate, which is based on the analysis of the SH signal covariance matrix. This algorithm is suited for the estimation of diffuseness arising either from the presence of multiple sources distributed around the SMA or from the presence of a diffuse noise background. As well, we introduce the concept of a diffuseness profile, which consists in measuring the diffuseness for several SH orders simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that diffuseness profiles better describe the properties of the sound field than a single diffuseness measurement.},

Many algorithms for source localization are based on the computation of the Generalized Cross-Correlation function between microphone pairs employing phase transform weighting. Unfortunately, the performance of these methods is severely reduced when wall reflections and multiple sound sources are present in the acoustic environment. As a result, estimating the number of active sound sources and their actual directions becomes a challenging task. To effectively tackle this problem, a Bayesian inference framework is proposed. Based on a nested sampling algorithm, a mixture model and its parameters are estimated, indicating both the number of sources—model selection—and their angle of arrival—parameter estimation, respectively. A set of measured data demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed model.},

Originally introduced in optics, their application to acoustic waves has recently opened exciting opportunities for exotic sound control. In conventional acoustic inclusions, the interactions with the impinging pressure and velocity are decoupled, limiting the functionalities that arrays of them can achieve. While the coupling between these two quantities in symmetry-breaking inclusions, known as Willis coupling, has been discussed for several years, only recently has it been realized that these phenomena can become nonperturbative in suitably tailored resonant scatterers. Here, we explore the opportunities that these Willis meta-atoms open in the context of acoustic metasurfaces, offering additional knobs to manipulate and tailor sound. The general response of Willis metasurface is analytically derived, yielding fundamental bounds and optimal surface responses enabling full control of the impinging acoustic wave front.},

Using the captured sound field, robust source localisation systems are required for speech acquisition, speaker tracking and environment mapping. Source localisation becomes a challenging problem in reverberant environments and under noisy conditions, leading to potentially poor performance in cocktail party scenarios. This paper evaluates the performance of a low-complexity localisation approach using spherical harmonics in reverberant environments for multiple speakers. Eigen-beams are used to estimate pseudo-intensity vectors pointing in the direction of sound intensity. This paper proposes a clustering approach in which the intensity vectors of active sound sources and strong reflections are extracted, yielding an estimate of the source direction in azimuth and inclination as an approach to source localisation.},

  abstract = {To eliminate the limitation of the conventional acoustic radiation torque theory, which is only applicable to a disklike scatterer in a plane sound field, a new theory is established to calculate the radiation torque on any irregularly shaped scatterer in any arbitrary sound field. First, with the aid of the conservation law of angular momentum, the acoustic radiation torque is expressed as the angular momentum flux through a spherical surface with the center at the scatterer’s centroid. Second, the velocity potential of the scattered field is derived, taking into account the influences of the translational and rotational movements of the scatterer induced by the first order stress of the incident sound field. Finally, a general calculating formula of the acoustic radiation torque is achieved. For a disklike scatterer in a plane sound filed, results from the above formula are well identical with those conventional formulas. By studying the case of a semicircular cylinder scatterer in a standing-wave sound field, it is found that for an irregularly shaped scatterer its rotation velocity is normally nonzero and the radiation torque changes with the spatial attitude.},

However, unlike the wavelength and polarization divisions, orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, despite its helical wavefront being an independent physical dimension, has not been implemented as an information carrier for holography due to the lack of helical mode index selectivity in the Bragg diffraction formula. Here, we demonstrate OAM holography by discovering strong OAM selectivity in the spatial-frequency domain without a theoretical helical mode index limit. As such, OAM holography allows the multiplexing of a wide range of OAM-dependent holographic images with a helical mode index spanning from −50 to 50, leading to a 10\,bit OAM-encoded hologram for high-security optical encryption. Our results showing up to 210 OAM-dependent distinctive holographic images mark a new path to achieving ultrahigh-capacity holographic information systems harnessing the previously inaccessible OAM division.},

We propose and experimentally demonstrate high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing nonlinear holography to overcome this problem. By dividing the wavefront of the fundamental wave into different orthogonal OAM channels, multiple OAM and polarization-dependent holographic images in both the fundamental wave and second-harmonic wave have been reconstructed independently in the spatial frequency domain through a type-II second harmonic generation process. Moreover, this method can be easily extended to cascaded χ2 nonlinear optical processes for multiplexing in more wavelength channels, leading to potential applications in multicasting in optical communications, multiwavelength display, multidimensional optical storage, anticounterfeiting, and optical encryption.},

The cylinder lies parallel or tilted with respect to the interface plane so that the azimuthal symmetry of the problem is destroyed. The scattering solution is first described in terms of an azimuthally symmetric free space solution. The multiple interactions of the scattered field with the interface are accounted for by an azimuthal-conversion matrix. In Sec. III, the method of this paper is benchmarked using wavefield superposition for a sphere near a pressure-release surface. Computed scattered spectra are shown for a finite cylinder, parallel and tilted with respect to the interface, and for a variety of source/receiver geometries. The differences resulting from not including multiple target/interface interactions (single scatter solution) and from including all interactions are presented. The problem of irregular frequencies for the single-scatter and the fully coupled BIEM are discussed and numerically examined.}

The paper begins with the presentation of the general theory that underpins sound field reproduction with secondary sources continuously arranged on the boundary of the reproduction region. The process of reproduction by a continuous source distribution is modeled by means of an integral operator (the single layer potential). It is then shown how the solution of the sound reproduction problem corresponds to that of an equivalent scattering problem. Analytical solutions are computed for two specific instances of this problem, involving, respectively, the use of a secondary source distribution in spherical and planar geometries. The results are shown to be the same as those obtained with analyses based on High Order Ambisonics and Wave Field Synthesis, respectively, thus bringing to light a fundamental analogy between these two methods of sound reproduction. Finally, it is shown how the physical optics (Kirchhoff) approximation enables the derivation of a high-frequency simplification for the problem under consideration, this in turn being related to the secondary source selection criterion reported in the literature on Wave Field Synthesis.},

  abstract = {With the proliferation of ultrahigh-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)1, the world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data that need to be processed in a fast and efficient way. Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important2. Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (1012 MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates3–5, ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides6,7, and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services.},

This study proposes two secondary loudspeaker placement optimization methods for multizone ANC of impulsive scattered sound from a rigid cylinder. The first method is frequency-domain weighted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and the second method is a time-domain iterative algorithm. Based on the two methods, a broadband feedforward ANC system is presented to suppress impulsive forward-scattered and backward-scattered sound. The experimental results show that compared with the configuration of uniformly placed loudspeakers and traditional LASSO algorithms, the proposed weighted LASSO algorithm and iterative algorithm achieve better control performance in the target and observing areas with less power when controlling 500~Hz–1000~Hz impulsive scattered sound.},

These solutions are then matched asymptotically obtain a farfield solution which includes the influence of nonlinear interaction within the Fresnel and Fraunhofer zones of the primary waves, from which an expression for the “equivalent difference‐frequency source level” is derived. The analysis assumes that the primary‐wave amplitudes, which induce the nonlinear interaction are below their respective shock thresholds as defined by a criterion which relates the steepest slope of the waveform to a predetermined upper bound approximation of an ideal discontinuity. In order to determine the predictive reliability of the solutions, a parameter which characterizes the “equivalent difference‐frequency source level” is compared with empirical results obtained over a wide range of experimental conditions. Finally, a quasiplane three‐dimensional equation (which in one dimension assumes the form of Burgers' equation) is also analyzed in order to obtain a second‐order farfield directivity function for the difference‐frequency signal.},

This function, which defines the saturation limit of a parametric array more completely than previous approximate models, permits the maximum conversion efficiency of the source to be evaluated for a particular set of input parameters.

  abstract = {Ultrasound is an inexpensive and widely used imaging modality for the diagnosis and staging of a number of diseases. In the past two decades, it has benefited from major advances in technology and has become an indispensable imaging modality, due to its flexibility and non-invasive character. In the last decade, research investigators and commercial companies have further advanced ultrasound imaging with the development of 3D ultrasound. This new imaging approach is rapidly achieving widespread use with numerous applications. The major reason for the increase in the use of 3D ultrasound is related to the limitations of 2D viewing of 3D anatomy, using conventional ultrasound. This occurs because: (a) Conventional ultrasound images are 2D, yet the anatomy is 3D, hence the diagnostician must integrate multiple images in his mind. This practice is inefficient, and may lead to variability and incorrect diagnoses. (b) The 2D ultrasound image represents a thin plane at some arbitrary angle in the body. It is difficult to localize the image plane and reproduce it at a later time for follow-up studies. In this review article we describe how 3D ultrasound imaging overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we describe the developments of a number of 3D ultrasound imaging systems using mechanical, free-hand and 2D array scanning techniques. Reconstruction and viewing methods of the 3D images are described with specific examples. Since 3D ultrasound is used to quantify the volume of organs and pathology, the sources of errors in the reconstruction techniques as well as formulae relating design specification to geometric errors are provided. Finally, methods to measure organ volume from the 3D ultrasound images and sources of errors are described.},

The proposed method (spherical equivalent source method) makes use of a point source expansion to describe the sound field on the rigid spherical array, from which it is possible to reconstruct the sound field over a three-dimensional domain, inferring all acoustic quantities: sound pressure, particle velocity, and sound intensity. The problem is formulated using a Neumann Green's function that accounts for the presence of the rigid sphere in the medium. One can reconstruct the total sound field, or only the incident part, i.e., the scattering introduced by the sphere can be removed, making the array virtually transparent. The method makes it possible to use sequential measurements: different measurement positions can be combined, providing an extended measurement area consisting of an array of spheres, and the sound field at any point of the source-free domain can be estimated, not being restricted to spherical surfaces. Because it is formulated as an elementary wave model, it allows for diverse solution strategies (least squares, ℓ1-norm minimization, etc.), revealing an interesting perspective for further work.},

  abstract = {This work examines the use of generative adversarial networks for reconstructing sound fields from experimental data. It is investigated whether generative models, which learn the underlying statistics of a given signal or process, can improve the spatio-temporal reconstruction of a sound field by extending its bandwidth. The problem is significant as acoustic array processing is naturally band limited by the spatial sampling of the sound field (due to the difficulty to satisfy the Nyquist criterion in space domain at high frequencies). In this study, the reconstruction of spatial room impulse responses in a conventional room is tested based on three different generative adversarial models. The results indicate that the models can improve the reconstruction, mostly by recovering some of the sound field energy that would otherwise be lost at high frequencies. There is an encouraging outlook in the use of statistical learning models to overcome the bandwidth limitations of acoustic sensor arrays. The approach can be of interest in other areas, such as computational acoustics, to alleviate the classical computational burden at high frequencies.},

  abstract = {Today’s cars must meet ever-higher acoustic standards, and so, to avoid compromising vehicle dynamics, handling performance and fuel consumption, standard passive methods alone do not provide sufficient performance. Active control solutions can provide a potential solution to this challenge, particularly at low frequency and such systems have been investigated for application to small cars, SUVs and luxury vehicles. These vehicles are generally characterised by fairly slow dynamics and limited noise emission and, therefore, this paper explores the challenging application of active noise control to a two-seat super sports car equipped with a naturally aspirated engine. This work aims to track and then control sounds characterised by extremely rapid frequency variation rates, up to peaks of over 80 Hz/s, and high sound pressure levels. A multi-channel, multi-order FxLMS based control system has been implemented, which has been modified to optimise performance for this application by including both convergence gain and leakage scheduling, to achieve effective control at the driver’s and passenger’s ears. To evaluate the performance of the controller, its performance has been simulated when applied to measurements taken under several vehicle manoeuvres, ranging from conventional constant engine speed to very fast engine run-ups. From the presented results, it is shown that the system can obtain high levels of control during the manoeuvre set, with the controller reducing the overall sound pressure level by more than 10 dB at certain frequencies when analysing a single order, and it reduces the overall loudness by around 5\% in all of the analysed cases.},

Two basic analytic methodologies-the explicit and the implicit-exist in order to derive the required loudspeaker driving functions. The explicit solution aims at the direct solution of the involved integral equation describing the general sound field synthesis problem, resulting in driving functions in the form of a spectral integral. The implicit solution extracts the driving function from an appropriate boundary integral representation of the target sound field. So far the relationship between two approaches was investigated for target field specific synthesis scenarios. For linear arrays this paper introduces a high-frequency approximation for the explicit solution resulting in a novel, purely spatial domain formulation of the direct approach. The presented driving functions allow the synthesis of an arbitrary virtual sound field, optimizing the reproduction on an arbitrary reference line. It is furthermore shown that for an arbitrary virtual sound field, the implicit solution constitutes a high-frequency approximation of the explicit method.},

  abstract = {One of the long term goals of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) minehunting is to have multiple inexpensive AUVs in a harbor autonomously classify hazards. Existing acoustic methods for target classification using AUV-based sensing, such as sidescan and synthetic aperture sonar, require an expensive payload on each outfitted vehicle and post-processing and/or image interpretation. A vehicle payload and machine learning classification methodology using bistatic angle dependence of target scattering amplitudes between a fixed acoustic source and target has been developed for onboard, fully autonomous classification with lower cost-per-vehicle. To achieve the high-quality, densely sampled three-dimensional (3D) bistatic scattering data required by this research, vehicle sampling behaviors and an acoustic payload for precision timed data acquisition with a 16 element nose array were demonstrated. 3D bistatic scattered field data were collected by an AUV around spherical and cylindrical targets insonified by a 7-9 kHz fixed source. The collected data were compared to simulated scattering models. Classification and confidence estimation were shown for the sphere versus cylinder case on the resulting real and simulated bistatic amplitude data. The final models were used for classification of simulated targets in real time in the LAMSS MOOS-IvP simulation package [M. Benjamin, H. Schmidt, P. Newman, and J. Leonard, J. Field Rob. 27, 834-875 (2010)].}

  abstract = {One of the factors that significantly affects bistatic scattering from seabed targets is bottom type. This factor has the potential to impact classification, as models that do not take bottom composition into account could improperly characterize target type, geometry, or material. This paper looks at the impact of bottom composition and self-burial on scattering from spherical and cylindrical targets in a 6.5 m deep environment with a mud and sand bottom. Sphere and cylinder scattering data from an autonomous underwater vehicle-based bistatic scattering experiment are compared to scattering simulation models with a range of bottom compositions and target burial increments. Three different sets of sediment parameters were tested. Correlation between the real and simulated data are then used to assess the similarity of each simulated scattering data set to the experiment data. Robustness to bottom composition in classification was then tested by training a model using simulated data and classifying experiment target data using a machine learning method for each environment type. Combined-environment classification models, composed of different ranges of mud depths and target burial increments, were shown to be effective at classifying the experiment data.}

An acoustic approach to this problem has been studied in which an acoustic source insonifies seabed target while receiving AUVs with passive sensing payloads discriminate targets based on features of the three dimensional scattered fields. The OASES-SCATT simulator was used to study how scattering data collected by mobile receivers around targets insonified by mobile sources might be used for sphere and cylinder target characterization in terms of shape, composition, and size. The impact of target geometry on these multistatic scattering fields is explored, and a discrimination approach developed in which the source and receiver circle the target with the same radial speed. The frequency components of the multistatic scattering data at different bistatic angles are used to form models for target characteristics. Data are then classified using these models. Classification accuracies were greater than 98\% for shape and composition. Regression for target volume showed potential, with 90\% chance of errors less than 15\%. The significance of this approach is to make classification using low-cost vehicles plausible from scattering amplitudes and the relative angles between the target, source, and receiver vehicles.}

Here, in contrast, we demonstrate a non-invasive, shadow-free, invisible sensor for airborne sound waves at audible frequencies, which fully absorbs the impinging signal, without at the same time perturbing its own measurement or creating a shadow. This unique sensing device is based on the unusual scattering properties of a parity-time (PT) symmetric metamaterial device formed by a pair of electro-acoustic resonators loaded with suitably tailored non-Foster electrical circuits, constituting the acoustic equivalent of a coherent perfect absorber coupled to a coherent laser. Beyond the specific application to non-invasive sensing, our work broadly demonstrates the unique relevance of PT-symmetric metamaterials for acoustics, loss compensation and extraordinary wave manipulation.},

We have developed a method to extract these effective properties from reflection and transmission coefficients, which can be measured experimentally. The dependency of effective properties on the positions of the boundaries of the acoustic metamaterial is discussed, and a proper procedure to determine the boundaries is presented. This retrieval method is used to analyze various acoustic metamaterials, and metamaterials with negative effective properties are reported.},

Here, I selectively review two theoretical perspectives and discuss ways in which these perspectives may help researchers understand the consequences for listeners of adding noise to a speech signal. I argue that adding noise changes more about the listening task than merely making the signal more difficult to perceive. To fully understand the effects of an added noise on speech perception, we must consider not just how much the noise affects task difficulty, but also how it affects all of the systems involved in understanding speech: increasing message uncertainty, modifying attentional demand, altering affective response, and changing motivation to perform the task.},

Although acoustics is a classical field, its promising, and indeed perplexing, capabilities in powerfully manipulating both fluids and particles within those fluids on the microscale to nanoscale has revived interest in it. The bewildering state of the literature and ample jargon from decades of research is reorganized and presented in the context of models derived from first principles. This hopefully will make the area accessible for researchers with experience in materials science, fluid mechanics, or dynamics. The abundance of interesting phenomena arising from nonlinear interactions in ultrasound that easily appear at these small scales is considered, especially in surface acoustic wave devices that are simple to fabricate with planar lithography techniques common in microfluidics, along with the many applications in microfluidics and nanofluidics that appear through the literature.},

  abstract = {Wave fields with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have been widely investigated in metasurfaces. By engineering acoustic metasurfaces with phase gradient elements, phase twisting is commonly used to obtain acoustic OAM. However, it has limited ability to manipulate sound vortices, and a more powerful mechanism for sound vortex manipulation is strongly desired. Here, we propose the diffraction mechanism to manipulate sound vortices in a cylindrical waveguide with phase gradient metagratings (PGMs). A sound vortex diffraction law is theoretically revealed based on the generalized conservation principle of topological charge. This diffraction law can explain and predict the complicated diffraction phenomena of sound vortices, as confirmed by numerical simulations. To exemplify our findings, we designed and experimentally verified a PGM based on Helmholtz resonators that support asymmetric transmission of sound vortices. Our work provides previously unidentified opportunities for manipulating sound vortices, which can advance more versatile design for OAM-based devices.},

  abstract = {This paper presented a novel ultrasonic wireless power link (UWPL) to provide power supply for embedded condition monitoring of enclosed metallic structures, where recharging or replacing batteries can be problematic. Two piezoelectric transducers are adopted to establish the wireless power links, within which one transducer is used to generate ultrasonic waves and the other is to receive the transferred ultrasonic energy and to energize the associated embedded condition monitoring units. A power management solution is established to regulate the receiver output into a constant voltage suitable for sensing application. A theoretical model was established to understand the UWPL dynamics and to analyze the energy budget balance between the UWPL and the sensing power demands. A finite element model was built to validate the proposed idea. The UWPL was then experimentally implemented using two piezoelectric transducers and tested in aluminium plates with different thickness. A power management sub-system was developed and tested for sensing applications. An output power of 1.73~mW was obtained on a 1.5~kΩ resister with the input voltage of 15~V at 42.6~kHz through a 6~mm-thick aluminium plate. Sufficient power can be transferred over a large distance via metallic structures, showing the capability in implementing battery-free condition monitoring of enclosed metallic structures, such as petroleum pipelines, engines, and aluminium airframe.},

  abstract = {A series of cationic calix[4]arene-based lipids with alkyl chains of varying length were newly synthesized, and the ones with propyl and hexyl tails, denoted by CaL[4]C3 and C6, respectively, were found to form spherical micelles at low pH (protonated state of the amine headgroup). Upon deprotonation with increasing pH, CaL[4]C3 showed a sphere-to-cylinder transition, while CaL[4]C6 changed from sphere, to cylinder, to monolayer vesicle. Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns from both spherical and cylindrical CaL[4]C3 micelles exhibited a sharp intensity minimum, indicating shape monodispersity. The monodispersity of the CaL[4]C3 spherical micelles was further confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). SAXS, AUC, and static light scattering agreeingly indicated an aggregation number of 6. In contrast, CaL[4]C6 exhibited polydispersity with an average aggregation number of 12. When the number of carbons of the alkyl chain was increased to 9 (CaL[4]C9), cylinder formed at low pH, while at high pH, no clear morphology could be observed. The present results indicate that a very precise combination of tail length, head volume, and rigidity of the building block is required to produce shape-persistent micelles and that the shape-persistence can be maintained upon a structural transition. An attempt to reconstruct a molecular model for the spherical CaL[4]C3 micelle was made with an ab initio shape determining program.}

They encode three-dimensional acoustic fields in two dimensions, and their quality determines the performance of acoustic systems. Optimisation methods that control only the phase of an acoustic wave are considered inferior to methods that control both the amplitude and phase of the wave. In this paper, we present Diff-PAT, an acoustic hologram optimisation platform with automatic differentiation. We show that in the most fundamental case of optimizing the output amplitude to match the target amplitude; our method with only phase modulation achieves better performance than conventional algorithm with both amplitude and phase modulation. The performance of Diff-PAT was evaluated by randomly generating 1000 sets of up to 32 control points for single-sided arrays and single-axis arrays. This optimisation platform for acoustic hologram can be used in a wide range of applications of PATs without introducing any changes to existing systems that control the PATs. In addition, we applied Diff-PAT to a phase plate and achieved an increase of\,\&gt;\,8\&nbsp;dB in the peak noise-to-signal ratio of the acoustic hologram.},

  abstract = {Low frequency noise has strong penetrability and has always been an important part of environmental pollution. Limited by the law of mass, traditional lightweight porous materials are difficult to effectively control low-frequency noise. Based on the characteristics of honeycomb structure, Helmholtz resonator and acoustic metamaterials, a kind of honeycomb like sandwich acoustic metamaterials is proposed. This structure combines the lightweight characteristics of honeycomb sandwich structure and Helmholtz resonance characteristics. The finite element models of honeycomb and Helmholtz resonators element are established. The transmission loss (TL) characteristic shows that Helmholtz resonators element will be a TL peak in a narrow frequency band than honeycomb element. The effects of neck diameter, neck length and cavity volume of Helmholtz resonator on its TL are analyzed. The TL of single and multiple Helmholtz resonators are compared. Furthermore, The TL of honeycomb panel and honeycomb like sandwich acoustic metamaterials are analyzed. The results show that the different TL peaks can be introduced into honeycomb like sandwich acoustic metamaterials with different neck diameters. Each Helmholtz resonators element plays an active role in its own frequency band. The sound insulation performance of the honeycomb like sandwich acoustic metamaterials is tested by impedance tube experiment. Excellent sound insulation ability is confirmed. The reasonable design of honeycomb like sandwich acoustic metamaterials structural parameters can solve the problem of low-frequency noise of thin-layer lightweight structure.},

The ASL is a directional parametric array loudspeaker whose 60 kHz carrier frequency is modulated by the anti-noise signal generated by adaptive ANC algorithm. The proposed method uses no secondary path estimate and is capable of canceling the tonal noise signals at distant target points, in real time. Using adaptive Leaky-NLMS algorithm, noise attenuation levels (NAL) of up to 15.71 dB are obtained in the presence of diffused low frequency background noise.

  abstract = {Topological phases of matter are classified based on their Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose real-valued dispersions together with orthogonal eigenstates form nontrivial topology. In the recently discovered higher-order topological insulators (TIs), the bulk topology can even exhibit hierarchical features, leading to topological corner states, as demonstrated in many photonic and acoustic artificial materials. Naturally, the intrinsic loss in these artificial materials has been omitted in the topology definition, due to its non-Hermitian nature; in practice, the presence of loss is generally considered harmful to the topological corner states. Here, we report the experimental realization of a higher-order TI in an acoustic crystal, whose nontrivial topology is induced by deliberately introduced losses. With local acoustic measurements, we identify a topological bulk bandgap that is populated with gapped edge states and in-gap corner states, as the hallmark signatures of hierarchical higher-order topology. Our work establishes the non-Hermitian route to higher-order topology, and paves the way to exploring various exotic non-Hermiticity-induced topological phases.},

  abstract = {Sound field reproduction aims to reconstruct a desired sound field in a listening area by using multiple loudspeakers. To improve sound field reproduction performance, several loudspeaker placement methods have been proposed to select suitable loudspeaker positions. However, most conventional loudspeaker placement methods do not consider the distribution characteristic of the desired sound fields such as the distribution of directions from where the sound wave emanates, making these methods not optimal when the prior knowledge of the distribution characteristic of the desired sound fields is known. In this paper, a weighted loudspeaker placement method is proposed, which considers optimizing the objective function that depends on a set of desired sound fields with different weights. This paper formulates the optimization problem for weighted loudspeaker placement, presenting three alternative discretization methods to obtain a more practical optimization problem, after which the group greedy method is used to solve the optimization problem to find the near-optimal loudspeaker setup. To validate the proposed method, numerical experiments aiming to reconstruct the desired sound wave from a restricted range are conducted. The results indicate that the proposed method performs well in both narrowband and broadband cases, because it can use prior knowledge of the distribution characteristic of the desired sound fields.},

Several multizone sound reproduction methods have been developed over the past few decades, and most of them assume that there are no listeners in the listening area. However, when listeners enter the listening area, the scattering effects will reduce the performance of the multizone sound reproduction system. In this paper, an adaptive control method of scattering effects is proposed for multizone sound reproduction. The proposed method models the scattering effects based on the equivalent source method and uses adaptive filters to estimate the scattering effect by a small number of additional microphones. To validate the proposed method, several simulations are presented. The results of the simulations indicate that the proposed adaptive method exhibits good performance when used in multizone sound reproduction with the scattering effects.},

  abstract = {We propose an equivalent piston model (EPM) for estimating the modal radiation efficiency of complex-shaped plates. In this model, the structure is not discretized into small elementary radiators. Instead, it involves determining the minimum number, size, volume velocity, and position of vibrating pistons that radiate in accordance with the mode shape they emulate, i.e. one piston per lobe within the mode shape, regardless the plate’s shape. For shapes relatively close to rectangles, a specific version of the method is proposed by representing the shape only by two characteristic lengths (EPM-RD), and paving the virtual surface with pistons vibrating at alternate phases along a rectangular grid. The validity of this assumption is evaluated in terms of shape dissymmetry, which can cause residual radiators to appear, and where the dissymmetry can affect the spatial distribution of lobes. With a known spatial distribution mimicking the mode shapes, it is possible to estimate also average values of radiation parameters, such as the average radiation efficiency and time-average mean power. The average radiation efficiency and power follow the Equipartition Theorem and allow the calculation to be performed without cross-terms and using only the modal efficiencies and resonance frequencies. Due to their simplicity and ease of implementation, piston-based equivalent models have great potential for solving radiation problems from flat structures. Any mode shape can be modeled with vibrating pistons and analytical formulations can be easily derived, even for complex geometries. Moreover, with EPM-RD, average values can also be calculated, which provides an estimation of average radiated properties within seconds without requiring any integration or large matrices to be solved.},

  abstract = {We propose a modal approach developed in the framework of the paraxial approximation to investigate the effects of deterministic surface perturbations in a planar waveguide. In the first part, the sensitivity of the modal amplitudes is theoretically formulated for a three-dimensional perturbation at the air–water interface. When applied to a broadband ultrasonic signal in a laboratory tank experiment, this approach results in travel-time and amplitude fluctuations that are successfully compared to experimental data recorded between two vertical source–receiver arrays that span the ultrasonic waveguide. The nonlinear shape of the modal amplitude fluctuations is of particular interest and is due to the three-dimensional nature of the surface perturbation. In the second part, a time-harmonic inversion method is built in the paraxial single-scattering approximation to image the dynamic surface perturbation from the modal transmission matrix between two source–receiver arrays. Again, the inversion results for capillary-gravity surface perturbations are successfully compared to similar inversions performed from experimental data processed with a complete set of eigenbeams extracted between the two arrays.},

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is a best-in-class machine learning algorithm for processing information generated by dynamical systems using observed time-series data. Importantly, it requires very small training data sets, uses linear optimization, and thus requires minimal computing resources. However, the algorithm uses randomly sampled matrices to define the underlying recurrent neural network and has a multitude of metaparameters that must be optimized. Recent results demonstrate the equivalence of reservoir computing to nonlinear vector autoregression, which requires no random matrices, fewer metaparameters, and provides interpretable results. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear vector autoregression excels at reservoir computing benchmark tasks and requires even shorter training data sets and training time, heralding the next generation of reservoir computing.},

  abstract = {Previously engineered wave-bearing materials including metamaterials generate their acoustic responses from a combination of passive geometrical structures possibly augmented by active elements. The passive geometrical features typically translate to uncontrolled properties outside the band of interest and are the source of adverse effects such as narrowing the operating band significantly or generating difficult-to-control instabilities due to interactions with the active elements. This paper proposes a nonlocal active metamaterial (NAM) architecture that employs a purely active approach to tailoring the acoustic field utilizing spatially separated sensors and actuators. A significant benefit of this approach is that the acoustic properties are described by analytical closed-form equations exposing the complex interplay between the various components of the material. The method is demonstrated by engineering extremely nonreciprocal wave transmission in an otherwise completely transparent subwavelength NAM. We experimentally demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of the system by electronically tuning the acoustic isolation characteristics and discuss the massive design space uncovered by the NAM approach.}

  abstract = {The parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) can realize sharp directivity using the straightness of ultrasound. Some recent studies have applied phase array approaches to PAL to control the directivity. The PAL is composed of a large aperture emitter consisting of multiple small ultrasonic transducers to exhibits sharper directivity and reproduce audible sound with sufficient sound pressure. In contrast, the directivity of the small-scale PAL may diffuse. In the present paper, we focus on forming a narrow acoustical beam for practical use of the PAL, so that it is able to control the area where the audible sound reproduced by the PAL can be heard. We propose a narrow-edged beamforming method based on individual phase inversion in the amplitude-modulated wave. The PAL is divided into interior part and exterior part, and the phases of the components in the signal fed to the exterior of the PAL are controlled individually. In the processing of the proposed method, the lower frequency component between the carrier and the sideband wave is phase-inverted in the signal fed to the exterior of the PAL. The proposed method uses phase cancellation of both ultrasound and demodulated audible sound to form a narrower beam. This method can also be combined with beam steering techniques to form a narrow steered beam. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in forming a narrower beam than the common PAL.},

  abstract = {The pseudospectral time-domain method (PSTD) provides an efficient way to solve the linear acoustics equations. With regards to acoustic modeling and auralization, source directivity as well as head-related directivity have a clear influence on the perceived sound field and have to be included in computations. In this paper directive sources are implemented in the time-domain method PSTD. First, a given frequency dependent source directivity is decomposed onto spherical harmonic functions. The directive source is then implemented through spatial distributions in PSTD that relate to the spherical harmonic functions, and time-dependent functions are assigned to the spatial distributions in order to obtain the frequency content of the directivity. Since any directivity function can be expressed as a summation of series of spherical harmonics, the approach can be used to model any type of directive source. For the evaluation of the method, a directivity function was designed analytically and then modeled in PSTD. Octave band analysis was performed and results show a good agreement between the analytical and simulated directivity. A distance related error was observed. However, for distances above 17.5 grid cells from the source center the average error was small ({$<$}0.9\,dB) at all octave-bands.},

  abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) in acoustics has received significant attention in the last decade, and thus motivates this special issue. CS emerged from the signal processing and applied math community and has since generated compelling results in acoustics. This special issue primarily addresses the acoustics CS topics of compressive beamforming and holography. For a sound field observed on a sensor array, CS reconstructs the direction of arrival of multiple sources using a sparsity constraint. Similarly, in holography a sparsity constraint gives improved sound field reconstruction over conventional  ℓ ℓ 2-regularization. Other topics in this issue include sparse array configurations (as co-arrays) and sparse sensing in acoustic communication.},

  abstract = {The spherical wave expansion with a single origin is sometimes used in connection with near-field acoustical holography to determine the sound field on the surface of a source. The radiated field is approximated by a truncated expansion, and the expansion coefficients are determined by matching the sound field model to the measured pressure close to the source. This problem is ill posed, and therefore regularization is required. The present paper investigates the consequence of using only the expansion truncation as regularization approach and compares it with results obtained when additional regularization (the truncated singular value decomposition) is introduced. Important differences between applying the method when using a microphone array surrounding the source completely and an array covering only a part of the source are described. Another relevant issue is the scaling of the wave functions. It is shown that it is important for the additional regularization to work properly that the wave functions are scaled in such a way that their magnitude on the measurement surface decreases with the order. Finally, the method is applied on nonspherical sources using a vibrating plate in both simulations and an experiment, and the performance is compared with the equivalent source method.},

Based on the proposed method, a MATLAB software package is constructed accordingly, and then verified and validated to compute the acoustic scattering by a rigid oblate or prolate spheroid in the Bessel beam. Several numerical examples are carried out to investigate the novel phenomenon of acoustic scattering by spheroids in Bessel beams with arbitrary incidence, with particular emphasis on the aspect ratio (i.e. the ratio of the polar radius over the equatorial radius of the spheroid), the half-cone angle of Bessel beam, the dimensionless frequency, as well as the angle of incidence. The quasi-periodic oscillations are observed in the plots of the far-field backscattering form function modulus versus the dimensionless frequency, owing to the interference between the specular reflection and the Franz wave circumnavigating the spheroid in the surrounding fluid. Furthermore, the 3D far-field scattering directivity patterns at end-on incidence and 2D polar plots at arbitrary angles of incidence are exhibited, which could provide new insights into the physical mechanisms of Bessel beam scattering by flat or elongated spheroid. This research work may provide an impetus for the application of acoustic Bessel beam in engineering practices.},

  abstract = {Acoustic radiation forces (ARFs) induced by a single Bessel beam with arbitrary order and location on a nonspherical shape are studied using the T-matrix method (TMM) in three dimensions. Based on the radiation stress tensor approach and the multipole expansion method for the arbitrary Bessel beam, the ARF expressions are derived in terms of the incident and scattered beam shape coefficients independently with the corresponding homemade code packages. Several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the versatility of the TMM. The axial ARFs of several typical shapes are considered in the analysis, with the emphasis on the axial ARF reversal and the corresponding physical mechanism. This study may guide the experimental setup to find negative axial ARFs quickly and effectively based on the predicted parameters with TMM. Relatively elongated shapes may be helpful for pulling forces in Bessel beams. Furthermore, the lateral ARFs for both convex and concave nonspherical shapes are also investigated with different topological charges, cone angles, and offsets of the particle centroid to the beam axis in a broadband frequency regime. A brief theoretical derivation of the incident beam shape coefficients for the standing Bessel beams is also given. The present work could help to design the acoustic tweezers numerical toolbox, which provides an acoustical alternative to the optical tweezers toolbox.},

  abstract = {Acoustic radiation torque (ART) plays an important role in the subject of acoustophoresis, which could induce the spinning rotation of particles on their own axes. The partial wave series method (PWSM) and T matrix method (TMM) are employed to investigate the three-dimensional radiation torques of both spherical and nonspherical objects in a single Bessel beam over broader frequencies (from Rayleigh scattering to geometric-optics regimes), with emphasis on the parametric conditions for torque reversal and the corresponding physical mechanisms. For elastic objects, the dipole, quadrupole, and even several higher-scattering modes are dominant to induce the axial ARTs beyond the Rayleigh limit with a relatively large offset from the particle centroid to the beam axis in Bessel beams. The reversals appear with parametric conditions (including wave number, cone angle, and offset) for the extrema or null values of the corresponding cylindrical Bessel functions. The reversal of transverse ART from a rigid nonspherical particle is also investigated in an ordinary Bessel beam and the geometrical surface roughness is briefly studied for the effect on the radiation torques. This suggests the possibility of acoustic tweezers controlling the spinning motion of particles within and beyond the Rayleigh limit.},

The PAL is advantageous in possessing a much narrower sound beam as compared to the conventional loudspeaker with the same size. The beampattern of the PAL is described by the convolution model that the directivity of the difference frequency is calculated by the convolution between the Westervelt's directivity and the product directivity of the ultrasonic frequencies. Previous beampattern design methods of the PAL have failed to consider the effect of the Westervelt's directivity. This paper proposes to use the mixed Gaussian directivity method to approximate the Westervelt's directivity, such that the convolution model can be analytically decomposed into solvable equations. A beampattern design method is therefore established and then validated by k-wave numerical simulations.}

For certain values of their geometrical parameters they show simultaneously negative effective bulk modulus and negative effective mass density. Here our analysis is focused on the frequencies where they behave like materials with negative density or density near zero (DNZ). The scattering units consist of a rigid cylindrical core surrounded by an anisotropic shell divided in angular sectors. The units are embedded in a 2D waveguide whose height is smaller than the length of the cylinders, which makes the structure quasi-2D. We have obtained the dispersion relation of the surface acoustic waves excited at frequencies with negative effective density. Also, we report phenomena associated with their DNZ behavior, such as tunneling through narrow channels, control of the radiation field, perfect transmission through sharp corners, and power splitting. Preliminary experiments performed on samples with millimeter-scale dimensions demonstrated their single-negative behavior, with the main drawback being the strong losses measured at the frequencies where the negative behavior is observed.},

  abstract = {The nonequispaced Fourier transform arises in a variety of application areas, from medical imaging to radio astronomy to the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In a typical problem, one is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in  O(NlogN) O(Nlog⁡N)  operations rather than  O( N 2 ) O(N2)  operations. Unfortunately, when the sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation and are often referred to as \{\textbackslash em nonuniform FFTs\} (NUFFTs). These rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on an oversampled grid [A. Dutt and V. Rokhlin, \{\textbackslash em SIAM J.\textbackslash{} Sci.\textbackslash{} Comput.\}, 14 (1993), pp. 1368--1383].\textbackslash\textbackslash{} \textbackslash indent\% In this paper, we observe that one of the standard interpolation or ``gridding" schemes, based on Gaussians, can be accelerated by a significant factor without precomputation and storage of the interpolation weights.

  abstract = {Back-focal plane (BFP) interferometry is a very fast and precise method to track the 3D position of a sphere within a focused laser beam using a simple quadrant photo diode (QPD). Here we present a concept of how to track and recover the 5D state of a cylindrical nanorod (3D position and 2 tilt angles) in a laser focus by analyzing the interference of unscattered light and light scattered at the cylinder. The analytical theoretical approach is based on Rayleigh-Gans scattering together with a local field approximation for an infinitely thin cylinder. The approximated BFP intensities compare well with those from a more rigorous numerical approach. It turns out that a displacement of the cylinder results in a modulation of the BFP intensity pattern, whereas a tilt of the cylinder results in a shift of this pattern. We therefore propose the concept of a local QPD in the BFP of a detection lens, where the QPD center is shifted by the angular coordinates of the cylinder tilt.}

  abstract = {The transport of energy through 1-dimensional (1D) waveguiding channels can be affected by sub-wavelength disorder, resulting in undesirable localization and backscattering phenomena. However, quantized disorder-resilient transport is observable in the edge currents of 2-dimensional (2D) topological band insulators with broken time-reversal symmetry. Topological pumps are able to reduce this higher-dimensional topological insulator phenomena to lower dimensionality by utilizing a pumping parameter (either space or time) as an artificial dimension. Here we demonstrate a temporal topological pump that produces on-demand, robust transport of mechanical energy using a 1D magneto-mechanical metamaterial. We experimentally demonstrate that the system is uniquely resilient to defects occurring in both space and time. Our findings open a path towards exploration of higher-dimensional topological physics with time as a synthetic dimension.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of sparse planar arrays can effectively reduce hardware costs and computational complexity in phased array 3-D imaging sonar systems. Traditional stochastic methods, such as simulated annealing, require multiple experiments and parameter adjustments to obtain optimal results. Methods based on compressed sensing (CS) can overcome this defect. However, when applied to large arrays, CS methods require vast computational complexity and may not obtain optimal sparse results because of violating the restricted isometry property. To make CS methods more practical, a distributed convex optimization CS method is proposed here for the sparse planar array synthesis in 3-D imaging sonar systems. This method is based on the CS theory, solving the minimum number of active elements under certain beam pattern constraints using the iterative reweighted l1-norm minimization algorithm. Then, a multistage distributed framework is proposed to decompose the array into multistage subarrays, and the array synthesis is performed sequentially for each stage subarray to reduce computational complexity and obtain higher sparsity rates. Some applications of sparse planar array synthesis are employed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging sonar systems require large planar arrays, which incur hardware costs. In contrast, a cross array consisting of two perpendicular linear arrays can also support 3-D imaging while dramatically reducing the number of sensors. Moreover, the use of an aperiodic sparse array can further reduce the number of sensors efficiently. In this paper, an optimized method for sparse cross array synthesis is proposed. First, the beamforming of a cross array based on a multi-frequency algorithm is simplified for both near-field and far-field. Next, a perturbed convex optimization algorithm is proposed for sparse cross array synthesis. The method based on convex optimization utilizes a first-order Taylor expansion to create position perturbations that can optimize the beam pattern and minimize the number of active sensors. Finally, a cross array with 100 + 100 sensors is employed from which a sparse cross array with 45 + 45 sensors is obtained via the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than existing methods for obtaining optimum results for sparse cross array synthesis in both the near-field and far-field.},

Here, we present an acoustofluidic centrifugation technique that leverages an entanglement of acoustic wave actuation and the spin of a fluidic droplet to enable nanoparticle enrichment and separation. By combining acoustic streaming and droplet spinning, rapid ({$<$}1 min) nanoparticle concentration and size-based separation are achieved with a resolution sufficient to identify and isolate exosome subpopulations. The underlying physical mechanisms have been characterized both numerically and experimentally, and the ability to process biological samples (including DNA segments and exosome subpopulations) has been successfully demonstrated. Together, this acoustofluidic centrifuge overcomes existing limitations in the manipulation of nanoscale ({$<$}100 nm) bioparticles and can be valuable for various applications in the fields of biology, chemistry, engineering, material science, and medicine.},

  abstract = {mSOUND is an open-source toolbox written in MATLAB. This toolbox is intended for modeling linear/ nonlinear acoustic wave propagation in media (primarily biological tissues) with arbitrary heterogeneities, in which, the speed of sound, density, attenuation coefficient, power-law exponent, and nonlinear coefficient are all spatially varying functions. The computational model is an iterative one-way model based on a mixed domain method. In this article, a general guideline is given along with three representative examples to illustrate how to set up simulations using mSOUND. The first example uses the transient mixed-domain method (TMDM) forward projection to compute the transient acoustic field for a given source defined on a plane. The second example uses the frequency-specific mixed-domain method (FSMDM) forward projection to rapidly obtain the pressure distribution directly at the frequencies of interest, assuming linear or weakly nonlinear wave propagation. The third example demonstrates how to use TMDM backward projection to reconstruct the initial acoustic pressure field to facilitate photoacoustic tomography (PAT). mSOUND (https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/home) is designed to be complementary to existing ultrasound modeling toolboxes and is expected to be useful for a wide range of applications in medical ultrasound including treatment planning, PAT, transducer design, and characterization.},

Despite notable theoretical breakthroughs, actual observation of NHSE’s whole evolvement, however, relies mainly on gain medium to provide amplified mode. It typically impedes the development of simple, robust system. Here, we show that a passive system is fully capable of supporting the observation of the complete evolution picture of NHSE, without the need of any gain medium. With a simple lattice model and acoustic ring resonators, we use complex-frequency excitation to create virtual gain effect, and experimentally demonstrate that exact NHSE can persist in a totally passive system during a quasi-stationary stage. This results in the transient NHSE: passive construction of NHSE in a short time window. Despite the general energy decay, the localization character of skin modes can still be clearly witnessed and successfully exploited. Our findings unveil the importance of excitation in realizing NHSE and paves the way towards studying the peculiar features of non-Hermitian physics with diverse passive platforms.},

  abstract = {Due to the pollution errors in acoustic analysis, the requirement of very refined meshes at high wavenumbers limits the practical application of the conventional finite element method (FEM). In this work, the three-node linear triangular element with linear interpolation cover functions (FEwC) is applied to solve acoustic radiation problems in two dimensions. The present FEwC has considerable generality since the polynomial interpolation cover functions can be easily implemented without changing the mesh topology. As the original linear approximation space is enriched by the cover functions, the FEwC can significantly alleviate the pollution errors and increase the convergence rate of the original low-order element in acoustic computation. We show the proper imposition of the Dirichlet boundary conditions in acoustic problems and illustrate an effective iterative algorithm to resolve the system equations with a singular coefficient matrix. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping technique is used to truncate the infinite problem domain into a bounded computational domain for the exterior problems and the Sommerfeld radiation condition then can be satisfied at infinity. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that the present scheme is a promising numerical tool for acoustic radiation problems.},

The actual computation can be performed by standard quadrature formulae and can be easily included in any existing computer code. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method, along with its insensitivity to the mesh pattern. This new method has full generality and, therefore, can be applied in any field of applied mechanics. Moreover, there are no restrictions on the numerical implementation, as the singular integrals may be defined on surface elements or internal cells of any order and type.},

  abstract = {Far field sound scattering from underwater elastic spheres and finite cylinders is considered over the full range of scattering angles. Three models for the frequency response of the scattered field are evaluated: a hybrid finite element/propagation simulation for a finite cylinder with broadside illumination, an approximate solution for the finite cylinder, and the exact solution for a sphere. The cylinder models are shown to give comparable results, attesting to the strength of the finite cylinder approximate solution. Interference and resonance structure present in the frequency response of the targets is identified and discussed, and the bistatic spectra for a variety of elastic sphere materials are presented. A thorough understanding of the complicated angle and frequency dependence of the scattering from simple elastic targets is helpful for interpretation of backscattering data from targets at or near an interface, or for scattering data taken by moving automated underwater vehicles, acoustic arrays, or other forms of data collection involving bistatic scattering.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations on the sphere-cylinder birefringence model (SCBM), and forward scattering experiments on samples containing polystyrene microspheres, well-aligned glass fibers and polyacrylamide, we examine in detail the relationship between the MMPD parameters and the microscopic structure of the samples. The results show that the spherical scatterers and birefringent medium contribute to depolarization and retardance respectively, but the cylindrical scatterers contribute to both. Retardance due to the cylindrical scatterers changes with their density, size and order of alignment. Total retardance is a simple sum of both contributions when cylinders are in parallel to the extraordinary axis of birefringence.},

  abstract = {Digital waveguide mesh (DWM) models offer a simple, accurate, time-domain, numerical solution of the wave equation. A specific case where such accurate and computationally simple solutions are needed is the acoustical modeling of open or closed volumes. It is possible to model 3-D propagation of waves in enclosures such as rooms using DWM models. Generally, idealized omnidirectional sources are used for obtaining the impulse response in the DWM. However, real-life sound sources are never completely isotropic, causing wavefronts with directional properties. This paper presents two methods to simulate analytical and empirical directivities in 3-D DWM models in the far-field. The first method is based on the direct excitation of the mesh with the velocity component of the directional source and is used to simulate analytical sources. The second method is based on the weighting of velocity components generated by an omnidirectional source at different octave-bands and is used to simulate sources with frequency-dependent empirical directivity functions. A simple interpolation method for obtaining a closed-form description of the directivity function from incomplete directivity data is also proposed. Simulation results are presented for two sources in an acoustical model of a rectangular room.},

As an example, we synthesize a nonreciprocal classical analog to electromagnetically induced transparency, opening a narrow window of one-way efficient transmission in an otherwise opaque surface. These properties pave the way to magnetic-free, planarized, nonreciprocal ultrathin surfaces for free-space isolation.},

  abstract = {A conventional approach to wideband multi-source (MS) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is to perform single source (SS) DOA estimation in time-frequency (TF) bins for which a SS assumption is valid. Such methods use the W-disjoint orthogonality (WDO) assumption due to the speech sparseness. As the number of sources increases, the chance of violating the WDO assumption increases. As shown in the challenging scenarios with multiple simultaneously active sources over a short period of time masking each other, it is possible for a strongly masked source (due to inconsistency of activity or quietness) to be rarely dominant in a TF bin. SS-based DOA estimators fail in the detection or accurate localization of masked sources in such scenarios. Two analytical approaches are proposed for narrowband DOA estimation based on the MS assumption in a bin in the spherical harmonic domain. In the first approach, eigenvalue decomposition is used to decompose a MS scenario into multiple SS scenarios, and a SS-based analytical DOA estimation is performed on each. The second approach analytically estimates two DOAs per bin assuming the presence of two active sources per bin. The evaluation validates the improvement to double accuracy and robustness to sensor noise compared to the baseline methods.},

  abstract = {A new photon skin dosimetry model, described here, was developed as the basis for the enhanced VARSKIN 4 thin tissue dosimetry code. The model employs a point-kernel method that accounts for charged particle build-up, photon attenuation and off-axis scatter. Early comparisons of the new model against Monte Carlo particle transport simulations show that VARSKIN 4 is highly accurate for very small sources on the skin surface, although accuracy at shallow depths is compromised for radiation sources that are on clothing or otherwise elevated from the skin surface. Comparison results are provided for a one-dimensional point source, a two-dimensional disc source and three-dimensional sphere, cylinder and slab sources. For very small source dimensions and sources in contact with the skin, comparisons reveal that the model is highly predictive. With larger source dimensions, air gaps or the addition of clothing between the source and skin; however, VARSKIN 4 yields over-predictions of dose by as much as a factor of 2 to 3. These cursory Monte Carlo comparisons confirm that significant accuracy improvements beyond the previous version were achieved for all geometries. Improvements were obtained while retaining the VARSKIN characteristic user convenience and rapid performance.},

While wave-based methods have traditionally been applied to low frequencies, their use in mid and high frequencies is becoming increasingly possible thanks to advances in high-performance and parallel computing. In such frequency ranges the effects of sound absorption in air become significant and cannot be neglected from simulations intended for auralization. In this paper, a system of equations relating to linear acoustics including viscothermal and relaxation effects in air is devised for the purposes of large-scale simulation of homogeneous urban/outdoor and indoor (room) acoustics, and for potential use in virtual reality. A discrete model is constructed for the free-space problem using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods, which is validated through numerical simulations and comparisons against analytical models.},

We derive the mathematical expression of OCS according to the radiometric theory, and put forward a fast visualization calculation method of complex space targets' OCS based on an OpenGL and 3D model. Through the OCS simulation of Lambert bodies (cylinder and sphere), the computational accuracy and speed of the algorithm were verified. By using this method, the relative error for OCS will not exceed 0.1\%, and it only takes 0.05 s to complete a complex calculation. Additionally, we calculated the OCS of three actual satellites with bidirectional reflectance distribution function model parameters in visible bands, and results indicate that it is easy to distinguish the three targets by comparing their OCS curves. This work is helpful for the identification and classification of unresolved space target based on photometric characteristics.}

In this paper, it is validated against case studies drawn from the “Ground Truth for Room Acoustical Simulation” database within a framework that includes source and receiver directivity. These aspects are often neglected but are respectively important to include for auralisation applications because source directivity is known to affect how a room is excited and because the human auditory system is sensitive to directional cues. The framework uses weighted-sums of spherical harmonic functions to represent both the source directivity to be simulated and the pressure field predicted in the vicinity of the receiver location, the coefficients of the former being fitted to measured directivity and those of the latter computed directly from the boundary data by evaluating a boundary integral. Three validation cases are presented, one of which includes a binaural receiver. The computed results match measurements closely for the two cases conducted in anechoic conditions but show some significant differences for the third room scenario; here, it is likely that uncertainty in boundary material data limited modelling accuracy.},

  abstract = {Fixed in spatial distribution, arrays of planar, electromechanical acoustic transducers cannot adapt their wave energy focusing abilities unless each transducer is externally controlled, creating challenges for the implementation and portability of such beamforming systems. Recently, planar, origami-based structural tessellations are found to facilitate great versatility in system function and properties through kinematic folding. In this research we bridge the physics of acoustics and origami-based design to discover that the simple topological reconfigurations of a Miura-ori-based acoustic array yield many orders of magnitude worth of reversible change in wave energy focusing: a potential for acoustic field morphing easily obtained through deployable, tessellated architectures. Our experimental and theoretical studies directly translate the roles of folding the tessellated array to the adaptations in spectral and spatial wave propagation sensitivities for far field energy transmission. It is shown that kinematic folding rules and flat-foldable tessellated arrays collectively provide novel solutions to the long-standing challenges of conventional, electronically-steered acoustic beamformers. While our examples consider sound radiation from the foldable array in air, linear acoustic reciprocity dictates that the findings may inspire new innovations for acoustic receivers, e.g. adaptive sound absorbers and microphone arrays, as well as concepts that include water-borne waves.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

  abstract = {The goal of this book is to expose the reader to the indispensable role that mathematics---often very abstract---plays in modern physics. Starting with the notion of vector spaces, the first half of the book develops topics as diverse as algebras, classical orthogonal polynomials, Fourier analysis, complex analysis, differential and integral equations, operator theory, and multi-dimensional Green's functions. The second half of the book introduces groups, manifolds, Lie groups and their representations, Clifford algebras and their representations, and fiber bundles and their applications to differential geometry and gauge theories. This second edition is a substantial revision of the first one with a complete rewriting of many chapters and the addition of new ones, including chapters on algebras, representation of Clifford algebras and spinors, fiber bundles, and gauge theories. The spirit of the first edition, namely the balance between rigor and physical application, has been maintained, as is the abundance of historical notes and worked out examples that demonstrate the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" in modern physics. Einstein has famously said, "The most incomprehensible thing about nature is that it is comprehensible." What he had in mind was reiterated in another one of his famous quotes concerning the question of how " ... mathematics, being after all a product of human thought, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality." It is a question that comes to everyone's mind when encountering the highly abstract mathematics required for a deep understanding of modern physics. It is the experience that Eugene Wigner so profoundly described as "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences."},

  abstract = {HYPOTHESIS: Initial studies (Hopkins Hatzopoulos et al. (2013)) have shown that ionic hydrotropic additives can drive a sphere-to-cylinder (ellipsoid) transition in water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions stabilized by the anionic surfactant Aerosol-OT; however the origins of this behaviour remained unclear. Here systematic effects of chemical structure are explored with a new set of hydrotropes, in terms of an aromatic versus a saturated cyclic hydrophobic group, and linear chain length of alkyl carboxylates. It is proposed that hydrotrope-induced microemulsion sphere-to-cylinder (ellipsoid) transitions are linked to additive hydrophobicity, and so a correlation between the bulk aqueous phase critical aggregation concentration (cac) and perturbation of microemulsion structure is expected. EXPERIMENTS: Water-in-oil microemulsions were formulated as a function of water content w (= [water]/[AOT]) and concentration of different hydrotropes, being either cyclic (sodium benzoate or sodium cyclohexanoate), or linear chain systems (sodium hexanoate, sodium heptanoate and sodium octanoate). Phase behaviour studies were performed as a function of w, additive type and temperature at total surfactant concentration [ST]=0.10M and constant mole fraction x=0.10 (x=[hydrotrope]/[ST]). Microemulsion domain structures were investigated by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and these data were fitted by structural models to yield information on the shapes (spheres, ellipsoids or cylinders) and sizes of the nanodroplets. FINDINGS: Under the conditions of study hydrotrope chemical structure has a significant effect on microemulsion structure: sodium cyclohexanoate does not induce the formation of cylindrical/ellipsoidal nanodroplets, whereas the aromatic analogue sodium benzoate does. Furthermore, the short chain sodium hexanoate does not cause anisotropic microemulsions, but the more hydrophobic longer chain heptanoate and octanoate analogues do induce sphere-to-ellipsoid transitions. This study shows that underlying microemulsion structures can be tuned by hydrotropes, and that the strength of the effect can be identified with hydrotrope hydrophobicity in terms of the bulk aqueous phase cac.},

  abstract = {Directional hearing may enable fishes to seek out prey, avoid predators, find mates, and detect important spatial cues. Early sound localization experiments gave negative results, and it was thought unlikely that fishes utilized the same direction-finding mechanisms as terrestrial vertebrates. However, fishes swim towards underwater sound sources, and some can discriminate between sounds from different directions and distances. The otolith organs of the inner ear detect the particle motion components of sound, acting as vector detectors through the presence of sensory hair cells with differing orientation. However, many questions remain on inner ear functioning. There are problems in understanding the actual mechanisms involved in determining sound direction and distance. Moreover, very little is still known about the ability of fishes to locate sound sources in three-dimensional space. Do fishes swim directly towards a source, or instead “sample” sound levels while moving towards the source? To what extent do fishes utilize other senses and especially vision in locating the source? Further behavioral studies of free-swimming fishes are required to provide better understanding of how fishes might actually locate sound sources. In addition, more experiments are required on the auditory mechanism that fishes may utilize.},

  abstract = {We present both the two-dimensional backscattering point-illumination and surface-illumination Mueller matrices for the anisotropic sphere-cylinder scattering media. The experimental results of the microsphere-silk sample show that the Mueller matrix elements of an anisotropic scattering medium are different from those of an isotropic medium. Moreover, both the experiments and Monte Carlo simulations show that the directions of the fibrous scatterers have prominent effects on the Mueller matrix elements. As the fibrous samples rotate, the surface-illumination Mueller matrix measurement results for the m12, m21, m13, m31, m22, m23, m32, and m33 elements represent periodical variations. Experiments on skeletal muscle and porcine liver tissue samples confirm that the periodical changes for the surface-illumination Mueller matrix elements are closely related to the well aligned fibrous scatterers. The m22, m23, m32, and m33 elements are powerful tools for quantitative characterization of anisotropic scattering media, including biological tissues.},

  abstract = {Polarization measurements are sensitive to the microstructure of tissues and can be used to detect pathological changes. Many tissues contain anisotropic fibrous structures. We obtain the local orientation of aligned fibrous scatterers using different groups of the backscattering Mueller matrix elements. Experiments on concentrically well-aligned silk fibers and unstained human papillary thyroid carcinoma tissues show that the m22 , m33 , m23 , and m32 elements have better contrast but higher degeneracy for the extraction of orientation angles. The m12 and m13 elements show lower contrast, but allow us to determine the orientation angle for the fibrous scatterers along all directions. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations based on the sphere-cylinder scattering model indicate that the oblique incidence of the illumination beam introduces some errors in the orientation angles obtained by both methods. Mapping the local orientation of anisotropic tissues may not only provide information on pathological changes, but can also give new leads to reduce the orientation dependence of polarization measurements.},

Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations based on the sphere-cylinder birefringence model (SCBM) provide additional information of the relations between the characteristic spectral features of the MMT parameters and the microstructures of the tissues. Comparisons between the experimental and simulated data confirm that the contrast mechanism of the transmission MMT imaging for cancer detection is the breaking down of birefringent normal tissues for cervical cancer, or the formation of birefringent surrounding structures accompanying the inflammatory reaction for thyroid cancer. It is also testified that, the characteristic spectral features of polarization imaging techniques can provide more detailed microstructural information of tissues for diagnosis applications.},

  abstract = {Recently many attempts have been made for extracting the structural information of myofibrils as indicators for diseases of skeletal muscle. In this paper we adopt wide-field illumination and take the backscattering Mueller matrix images of bovine skeletal muscle tissues during the 24-hour experimental time after the animal's death. The 2D images of Mueller matrix elements and their frequency distribution histograms (FDHs) reveal rich qualitative information on the changes in the microstructures of the skeletal muscle. The temporal variations of the sample are quantitatively analyzed using two Mueller matrix transformation (MMT) parameters. The characteristic features of the temporal plots are attributed to the rigor mortis and proteolysis processes. For a deeper insight on the relationship between the features of the MMT parameters and the microstructures during the rigor mortis and proteolysis processes, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are carried out based on sphere-cylinder birefringence model (SCBM). The good agreement between the experimental and MC simulated results show that the FDHs and MMT parameters can describe more clearly the characteristic microstructural features of skeletal muscle tissues. The techniques are useful for the characterization of physiological status of tissues, or quantitative assessment of meat qualities in food industry.},

Markedly different from the newly observed unconventional quasiparticles, such as the spin-1 Weyl points and the charge-2 Dirac points featuring respectively threefold and fourfold band crossings, the charge-2 Weyl points identified here are simply twofold degenerate, and the dispersions around them are quadratic in two directions and linear in the third one. Besides the essential nonlinear bulk dispersions, we further unveil the exotic double-helicoid surface arcs that emanate from a projected quadratic Weyl point and terminate at two projected conventional Weyl points. This unique global surface connectivity provides conclusive evidence for the double topological charges of such unconventional topological nodes.},

  abstract = {A simple four-panel transducer capable of producing a beam with a screw dislocation along its axis was constructed and evaluated. A screw dislocation in a wavefront is characterized by a phase dependence about the dislocation axis that varies as exp(−imφ), where m is an integer and φ is the angle about the axis. At the axis, the phase is indeterminate and as a result there is a corresponding null in the pressure magnitude. The screw dislocation in the transducer beam is along the beam axis and is found to exist in both the far- and near-fields of the transducer. This null then clearly indicates the axis of the beam at all distances and has the potential to be used as an aid in the alignment of objects in sonar experiments or other similar applications. The helicoidal wave is also shown to possess axial angular momentum. A related transducer was summarized previously [J. Acoust. Soc.

The concept of a spiral wave front beacon is developed by combining this source with a reference source that has a phase that is constant with the angle. The phase difference between these sources contains information about the receiver’s azimuthal angle relative to the beacon and can be used for underwater navigation. To produce the spiral wave front, two sources are considered: a “physical-spiral” source, which produces the appropriate phase by physically deforming the active element of the source into a spiral, and a “phased-spiral” source, which uses an array of active elements, each driven with the appropriate phase, to produce the spiral wave front. Using finite element techniques, the fields produced by these sources are examined in the context of the spiral wave front beacon, and the advantages of each source are discussed.},

  abstract = {Absorbed doses caused by electron irradiation were calculated with Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP) for thin layers of tissue-equivalent materials. The layers were so thin that the calculation of energy deposition was on the border of the scope of MCNP. Therefore, in this article application of three different methods of calculation of energy deposition is discussed. This was done by means of two scenarios: in the first one, electrons were emitted from the centre of a sphere of water and also recorded in that sphere; and in the second, an irradiation with the PTB Secondary Standard BSS2 was modelled, where electrons were emitted from an (90)Sr/(90)Y area source and recorded inside a cuboid phantom made of tissue-equivalent material. The speed and accuracy of the different methods were of interest. While a significant difference in accuracy was visible for one method in the first scenario, the difference in accuracy of the three methods was insignificant for the second one. Considerable differences in speed were found for both scenarios. In order to demonstrate the need for calculating the dose in thin small zones, a third scenario was constructed and simulated as well. The third scenario was nearly equal to the second one, but a pike of lead was assumed to be inside the phantom in addition. A dose enhancement (caused by the pike of lead) of approximately 113 \% was recorded for a thin hollow cylinder at a depth of 0.007 cm, which the basal-skin layer is referred to in particular. Dose enhancements between 68 and 88 \% were found for a slab with a radius of 0.09 cm for all depths. All dose enhancements were hardly noticeable for a slab with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm(2), which is usually applied to operational radiation protection.},

Viscous and thermal losses are considered in the linearized Navier-Stokes equations with no flow. Despite the extremely low thicknesses of boundary layers associated with each type of losses, the double-negative behavior is totally suppressed for the rigid structures under analysis. In other words, almost 100\% of the energy transmitted into the slab is dissipated by viscothermal effects, in agreement with experimental data. Simulations undertaken for larger structures, using scale factors of up to 20 times, show that double-negative behavior is never recovered. The huge dissipation obtained by these structures leads us to propose them as interesting alternatives to conventional absorbers for specific situations, e.g., when treating low frequencies or when the excitation is narrow banded.},

Orientation of each rod is independently controlled by an external electric motor that allows continuous variation of the local scattering parameters and dispersion of sound in the entire crystal. Due to asymmetry of the scatterers, the crystal band structure possesses highly anisotropic band gaps. Synchronous rotation of all the scatterers by a definite angle changes the regime of reflection to the regime of transmission and vice versa. The same mechanically tunable structure functions as a gradient index medium by incremental, angular reorientation of rods along both row and column, and, subsequently, can serve as a tunable acoustic lens, an acoustic beam splitter, and finally an acoustic beam steerer.},

The generalized approach exploits the similarities in these scattering problems to present a single system of equations that is easily specialized to cylindrical or spherical scatterers. By employing field expansions based on orthogonal harmonic functions, continuity of pressure and normal particle velocity are directly enforced at each scatterer using diagonal, analytic expressions to eliminate the need for integral equations. The effect of a cylinder or sphere that encloses all other scatterers is simulated with an outer iterative procedure that decouples the inner-object solution from the effect of the enclosing object to improve computational efficiency when interactions among the interior objects are significant. Numerical results establish the validity and efficiency of the outer iteration procedure for nested objects. Two- and three-dimensional methods that employ this outer iteration are used to measure and characterize the accuracy of two-dimensional approximations to three-dimensional scattering of elevation-focused beams.},

The eigenvectors, i.e., the modal shapes, represent combinations of the amplitude and polarity of individual loudspeakers. The eigenvalues indicate the reactive-to-active ratio of the acoustic power generated by the loudspeaker array. Hence, the loudspeaker array is designed according to the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue to maximize the reactive-to-active ratio. In this study, a planar array consisting of nine loudspeakers is constructed, and the acoustic radiation characteristics are experimentally investigated.},

  abstract = {Real-time beam predictions are highly desirable for the patient-specific computations required in ultrasound therapy guidance and treatment planning. To address the longstanding issue of the computational burden associated with calculating the acoustic field in large volumes, we use graphics processing unit (GPU) computing to accelerate the computation of monochromatic pressure fields for therapeutic ultrasound arrays. In our strategy, we start with acceleration of field computations for single rectangular pistons, and then we explore fast calculations for arrays of rectangular pistons. For single-piston calculations, we employ the fast near-field method (FNM) to accurately and efficiently estimate the complex near-field wave patterns for rectangular pistons in homogeneous media. The FNM is compared with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld method (RSM) for the number of abscissas required in the respective numerical integrations to achieve 1\%, 0.1\%, and 0.01\% accuracy in the field calculations. Next, algorithms are described for accelerated computation of beam patterns for two different ultrasound transducer arrays: regular 1-D linear arrays and regular 2-D linear arrays. For the array types considered, the algorithm is split into two parts: 1) the computation of the field from one piston, and 2) the computation of a piston-array beam pattern based on a pre-computed field from one piston. It is shown that the process of calculating an array beam pattern is equivalent to the convolution of the single-piston field with the complex weights associated with an array of pistons. Our results show that the algorithms for computing monochromatic fields from linear and regularly spaced arrays can benefit greatly from GPU computing hardware, exceeding the performance of an expensive CPU by more than 100 times using an inexpensive GPU board. For a single rectangular piston, the FNM method facilitates volumetric computations with 0.01\% accuracy at rates better than 30 ns per field point. Furthermore, we demonstrate array calculation speeds of up to 11.5 × 109 field-points per piston per second (0.087 ns per field point per piston) for a 512-piston linear array. Beam volumes containing 2563 field points are calculated within 1 s for 1-D and 2-D arrays containing 512 and 202 pistons, respectively, thus facilitating future real-time thermal dose predictions.},

  abstract = {Acoustic black holes (ABHs) are structural features that can be embedded into plates to provide effective structural damping. However, the performance of an embedded ABH is limited by its size, which determines the ABH cut-on frequency. It is not always practicable to increase the size of an ABH to reduce its cut-on frequency, however, previous work has shown that active vibration control can instead be used to enhance the low frequency performance of an ABH beam termination. This paper presents an investigation into the potential performance benefits that can be achieved by implementing active control into an array of ABHs embedded in a plate, realising an array of active ABHs (AABHs). The potential performance advantage is investigated here through experimental investigations, where different configurations of passive and active control treatments are applied to both a plate with embedded ABHs and a constant thickness plate. The smart structures utilise piezoelectric patches to realise the control actuation and employ an active feedforward multichannel vibration control strategy that aims to minimise the structural response monitored by an array of accelerometers. The performance of each plate configuration is evaluated in terms of the attenuation in the structural response and the energy, or control effort required. The presented experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the constant thickness plate configuration, the AABHs provide considerable passive damping above the ABH cut-on frequency and significantly reduce the required control effort.},

The associated 3D Zernike moments have been successfully applied for 3D shape recognition; they are popular in structural biology for comparing protein structures and properties. Many algorithms have been proposed for computing those moments, starting from a voxel-based representation or from a surface based geometric mesh of the shape. As the order of the 3D Zernike moments increases, however, those algorithms suffer from decrease in computational efficiency and more importantly from numerical accuracy. In this paper, new algorithms are proposed to compute the 3D Zernike moments of a homogeneous shape defined by an unstructured triangulation of its surface that remove those numerical inaccuracies. These algorithms rely on the analytical integration of the moments on tetrahedra defined by the surface triangles and a central point and on a set of novel recurrent relationships between the corresponding integrals. The mathematical basis and implementation details of the algorithms are presented and their numerical stability is evaluated.},

  abstract = {The ability to acoustically cloak an object, effectively making the object acoustically invisible to an outside observer, is of interest in many applications where the presence of an object has an undesirable impact on the sound-field. If a suitable disturbance signal can be measured, an active control system can be used to directly minimise the scattered acoustic pressure, which fully characterises the presence of the body. In this paper, a broadband feedforward active control system is used to minimise the scattered acoustic pressure at a far-field microphone array using an array of structural control sources affixed to the flexible scattering body. The performance of this system is assessed using measured data corresponding to a hollow cylindrical shell subject to an incident acoustic field, and the causality of the control filters is investigated. It is shown that the practical causality constraint limits the performance of the active cloak at lower frequencies, but the causally constrained controller is able to achieve approximately 10~dB of attenuation in the far-field scattered acoustic power, using an array of 9 control actuators. The influence that the number of control actuators has on the attenuation performance is investigated, the practicability of the system is discussed, and a number of potential implementation challenges are identified, including the increased level of structural vibration caused by the active structural acoustic cloaking system.},

Advances from the modern era of electroacoustics, psychophysical studies of loudness, and other related hearing studies are reviewed with respect to the development and application of human auditory weighting functions, particularly A-weighting. The use of auditory weighting functions to assess the effects of environmental noise on humans—such as hearing damage-risk criteria—are presented, as well as lower-level effects such as annoyance and masking. The article also reviews marine mammal auditory weighting functions, the development of which has been fundamentally directed by the objective of predicting and preventing noise-induced hearing loss. Compared to the development of human auditory weighting functions, the development of marine mammal auditory weighting functions have faced additional challenges, including a large number of species that must be considered, a lack of audiometric information on most species, and small sample sizes for nearly all species for which auditory data are available. The review concludes with research recommendations to address data gaps and assumptions underlying marine mammal auditory weighting function design and application.},

Their very existence defies conventional wisdom. Although BICs were first proposed in quantum mechanics, they are a general wave phenomenon and have since been identified in electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves in air, water waves and elastic waves in solids. These states have been studied in a wide range of material systems, such as piezoelectric materials, dielectric photonic crystals, optical waveguides and fibres, quantum dots, graphene and topological insulators. In this Review, we describe recent developments in this field with an emphasis on the physical mechanisms that lead to BICs across seemingly very different materials and types of waves. We also discuss experimental realizations, existing applications and directions for future work.},

Based on a theoretical model, energy radiation and dissipation of the resonator and its interaction with the acoustic enclosure are scrutinized. Numerical studies show the possibility of using mistuned resonators to maximize the noise reduction, as well as the tuning level required for different narrow frequency bands of interests. The effects of the internal resistance of the resonators as well as its dominance levels in the energy dissipation process are also demonstrated.

In soundfiled theory, reproduction algorithms are often developed assuming arrays of ideal point sources. However in practice, the directional characteristics of commercial loudspeakers are far from that of ideal point sources. Therefore, in order to successfully realize existing theoretical solutions for soundfield reproduction, it is crucial to understand and model the incident response of commercial loudspeakers used in the reproduction system as observed over the target region of reproduction. In this paper, we present initial work on formulating such a theoretical model, using a set of limited measurements in the reproduction region. A successful model shall enable the prediction of the loudspeaker's incident field away from the measurement points. This feature of the model is validated using extra measurements away from the initial ones.},

We present a comprehensive research of this source feature, including (i) an illustration confirming its sole dependence on the source position, (ii) a feature estimator in the presence of noise, (iii) a feature selector exploiting its inherent directivity over space. Source features at varied spherical harmonic modes, representing unique characterization of the soundfield, are fused by the Multi-Mode Gaussian Process modeling. Based on the unifying model, we then formulate the mapping function revealing the underlying relationship between the source feature(s) and position(s) using a Bayesian inference approach. Another issue of the overlapped components is addressed by a pre-processing technique performing overlapped frame detection, which in turn reduces this challenging problem to a single source localization. It is highlighted that this data-driven method has a strong potential to be implemented in practice because only a limited number of labeled measurements is required. We evaluate this proposed algorithm using simulated recordings between multiple speakers in diverse environments, and extensive results confirm improved performance in comparison with the state-of-art methods. Additional assessments using real-life recordings further prove the effectiveness of the method, even at unfavorable circumstances with severe source overlapping.},

This proposed MUSIC approach is also decomposed into the spherical harmonics domain where a frequency smoothing technique is allowed to de-correlate the coherent source signals for improved localization accuracy. The proposed algorithm is also capable of estimating the number of active sound sources, which is pre-requisite knowledge for the traditional MUSIC approach.

  abstract = {Acoustic contrast control (ACC) is one of the most commonly utilized sound zone control methods, which maximizes the ratio of the average squared sound pressure in two control zones. The time-domain formulation of ACC (TACC) is usually preferred since it can optimize the whole bandwidth in a single step and the resulting control filter is guaranteed to be causal. Many researchers have noted that TACC suffers from uneven frequency response. However, a convincing theoretical explanation of this problem is yet to be investigated. In this letter, an asymptotically equivalent frequency-domain form of TACC is constructed, based on which it can be proven that TACC has the tendency of extracting the specific frequency component with the highest contrast. Simulation results validate the efficacy of this theoretical analysis.},

  abstract = {Airy beams are peculiar beams that are nondiffracting, self-accelerating, and self-healing, and they have offered great opportunities for ultrasound-beam manipulation. However, one critical barrier that limits the broad applications of Airy beams in ultrasound is the lack of simply built devices to generate Airy beams in water. This work presents a family of Airy-beam-enabled binary acoustic metasurfaces (AB BAMs) to generate Airy beams for underwater ultrasound-beam manipulation. AB BAMs are designed and fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing with two coding bits: a polylactic acid (which is the commonly used 3D printing material) unit acting as a bit “1” and a water unit acting as a bit “0.” The distribution of the binary units on the metasurface is determined by the pattern of Airy beam. To showcase the wave-front engineering capability of the AB BAMs, several examples of AB BAMs are designed, 3D printed, and coupled with a planar single-element ultrasound transducer for experimental validation. We demonstrate the capability of AB BAMs in flexibly tuning the focal region size and beam focusing in 3D space by changing the design of the AB BAMs. The focal depth of AB BAMs can be continuous and electronical tuned by adjusting the operating frequency of the planar transducer without replacing the AB BAMs. The superimposing method is leveraged to enable the generation of complex acoustic fields, e.g., multifoci and letter patterns (e.g., “W” and “U”). The more complex focal patterns are shown to be also continuously steerable by simply adjusting the operating frequency. Furthermore, the proposed 3D-printed AB BAMs are simple to design, easy to fabricate, and low cost to produce with the capabilities to achieve tunable focal size, flexible 3D beam focusing, arbitrary multipoint focusing, and continuous steerability, which creates unprecedented potential for ultrasound-beam manipulation.}

  abstract = {Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for multiple simultaneous speakers in reverberant environments is still one of the challenging tasks in the audio signal processing field. A recent approach addresses this problem using a spherical harmonics domain feature named relative harmonic coefficients (RHC). Based on a bin-wise operation across the STFT (short-time Fourier transform) domain, this method detects the direct-path RHC in the first stage, followed by single source localization in the second stage. However, the method is computationally expensive as each STFT bin requires an exhaustive grid search over the two-dimensional (2-D) directional space. In this paper, we propose a significantly more computationally efficient alternative that decouples the azimuth and elevation 2-D search to two separate one-dimensional (1-D) search. The proposed multi-speaker localization algorithm comprises of two main steps, responsible for: (i) achieving a joint direct-path RHC detection and decoupled DOA estimation using 1-D search; and (ii) counting the number of speakers and estimating their DOAs based on the estimates from direct-path dominated STFT bins. Experiments using both simulated and real-life reverberant recordings confirm the significant computational complexity reduction while achieving competitive localization accuracy, compared to the baseline approaches. Although our proposed method performs in an unsupervised manner, it proves to be applicable even under unfavorable acoustic environments with a high reverberation level (e.g., \$T\_60=1\$ second).},

Rotational Doppler effect provides us an intuitive paradigm to shifting the frequency in a linear system, which needs to be facilitated by a spiraling phase change upon the wave propagation. Here we numerically and experimentally present a rotating linear vortex metasurface and achieve close-to-unity mode purity (above 95\%) and conversion efficiency (above 65\%) in audible sound frequency as low as 3000 Hz. The topological charge of the transmitted sound is almost immune from the rotational speed and transmissivity, demonstrating the mechanical robustness and stability in adjusting the high-performance frequency conversion in situ. These features enable us to cascade multiple vortex metasurfaces to further enlarge and diversify the extent of sound frequency conversion, which are experimentally verified. Our strategy takes a step further towards the freewheeling sound manipulation at acoustic frequency domain, and may have far-researching impacts in various acoustic communications, signal processing, and contactless detection.},

Here we report a wearable ultrasonic device for continuous, real-time and direct cardiac function assessment. We introduce innovations in device design and material fabrication that improve the mechanical coupling between the device and human skin, allowing the left ventricle to be examined from different views during motion. We also develop a deep learning model that automatically extracts the left ventricular volume from the continuous image recording, yielding waveforms of key cardiac performance indices such as stroke volume, cardiac output and ejection fraction. This technology enables dynamic wearable monitoring of cardiac performance with substantially improved accuracy in various environments.},

It is found that, if the classical elastic continuum is used to represent the original mass-in-mass lattice system, the effective mass density becomes frequency dependent and may become negative for frequencies near the resonance frequency of the internal mass. In contrast, if a multi-displacement microstructure continuum model is used to represent the mass-in-mass lattice system, the dispersive behavior of wave propagation and the band gap structure can be adequately described. However, while the acoustic mode is accurately described by the microstructure continuum model, the description of the optical mode is accurate only for a limited frequency range.},

  abstract = {This article presents a theoretical study of differential beamforming with uniform linear arrays. By defining a forward spatial difference operator, any order of the spatial difference of the observed signals can be represented as a product of a difference operator matrix and the microphone array observations. Consequently, differential beamforming is implemented in two stages, where the first one obtains spatial difference of the observations and the second stage optimizes the beamformer. The major contributions of this article are as follows. First, we propose a new theory of differential beamforming with uniform linear arrays, which shows clearly the connection between the conventional differential beamforming and the null-constrained differential beamforming methods. This provides some new insight into the design of differential beamformers. Second, we deduce some new differential beamformers, where conventional beamforming may be seen as a particular case. Specifically, we derive the maximum white noise gain (MWNG), maximum directivity factor (MDF), parameterized MDF, and parameterized maximum front-to-back ratio differential beamformers. Third, we further extend the idea of how to design optimal differential beamformers by combining both the observed signals and their spatial differences.},

A prospective method should provide the wide-angle, pulsed field emitted by an arbitrary planar source distribution and propagating in a three-dimensional, large scale domain holding a nonlinear acoustic medium. In this paper, a method is presented that is free of any assumed wavefield directionality. The nonlinear acoustic wave equation is solved by treating the nonlinear term as a contrast source. This formulation leads to an iterative scheme that involves the repetitive solution of a linear wave problem through Green’s function method. It is shown that accurate field predictions may be obtained within a few iterations. Moreover, by employing a dedicated numerical convolution technique, the method allows for a discretization down to two points per wavelength or period of the highest frequency of interest. The performance of the method is evaluated through a number of nonlinear field predictions for pulsed transducers with various geometries. The results demonstrate the directional independence of the method. Moreover, comparison with results from several existing methods shows that the method accurately predicts the nonlinear field for weak to moderate nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {Localization of underwater sound sources and characterization of ambient noise fields can be achieved through measurement of the sound intensity vector. To evaluate this concept, a passive hydrophone array called SIRA (Sound Intensity Receiver Array) has been developed for measurement of underwater sound intensity in the frequency range 100 to 6000 Hz. The array is composed of three pairs of omnidirectional hydrophones with the pairs aligned along orthogonal axes. The intensity is the time average of the product of instantaneous acoustic pressure and particle velocity. The instantaneous pressure is the average of the pressures measured by a hydrophone pair and the velocity is derived from the pressure gradient. Each hydrophone pair provides one of the components of the three dimensional intensity vector. Preliminary intensity measurements made at the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic (DREA) calibration barge facility are presented. The high angular resolution of the intensity measurements is demonstrated as well as the effect of ambient noise on the magnitude of the intensity.},

  abstract = {Previously, rotons were observed in correlated quantum systems at low temperatures, including superfluid helium and Bose-Einstein condensates. Here, following a recent theoretical proposal, we report the direct experimental observation of roton-like dispersion relations in two different three-dimensional metamaterials under ambient conditions. One experiment uses transverse elastic waves in microscale metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies. The other experiment uses longitudinal air-pressure waves in macroscopic channel–based metamaterials at audible frequencies. In both experiments, we identify the roton-like minimum in the dispersion relation that is associated to a triplet of waves at a given frequency. Our work shows that designed interactions in metamaterials beyond the nearest neighbors open unprecedented experimental opportunities to tailor the lowest dispersion branch—while most previous metamaterial studies have concentrated on shaping higher dispersion branches.},

  abstract = {Two experiments explored how frequency content impacts sound localization for sounds containing reverberant energy. Virtual sound sources from thirteen lateral angles and four distances were simulated in the frontal horizontal plane using binaural room impulse responses measured in an everyday office. Experiment 1 compared localization judgments for one-octave-wide noise centered at either 750 Hz (low) or 6000 Hz (high). For both band-limited noises, perceived lateral angle varied monotonically with source angle. For frontal sources, perceived locations were similar for low- and high-frequency noise; however, for lateral sources, localization was less accurate for low-frequency noise than for high-frequency noise. With increasing source distance, judgments of both noises became more biased toward the median plane, an effect that was greater for low-frequency noise than for high-frequency noise. In Experiment 2, simultaneous presentation of low- and high-frequency noises yielded performance that was less accurate than that for high-frequency noise, but equal to or better than for low-frequency noise. Results suggest that listeners perceptually weight low-frequency information heavily, even in reverberant conditions where high-frequency stimuli are localized more accurately. These findings show that listeners do not always optimally adjust how localization cues are integrated over frequency in reverberant settings.},

  abstract = {Underwater sound reflections can be reduced in magnitude by a rubber coating including three-dimensional (3-D) cavities forming a doubly periodic diffraction grating. A monopole resonance for sphere-like cavities enhances absorption in the surrounding rubber solid. A corresponding resonance for an infinite cylinder is studied in the present paper. Appearing at a considerably lower frequency than for a sphere with the same radius, it suggests the possibility of much thinner anechoic coatings including cylindrical cavities, with axes in a lateral direction, forming a diffraction grating with a single period. This is effectively a 2-D case, because of invariance in the axial direction. Subsequent coating design computations, using the layer-multiple-scattering method and including cavities of different sizes, show improved reflection reduction with coatings only about one third as thick. Still accounting for multiple scattering among the cavities and capturing the essential physics, the monopole approximation is applied to advance the analytic study of the reflection reduction. An energy decomposition relation is derived and used to quantify the absorption of the incident sound energy by cavities of different sizes. Coatings based on filled inclusions and other resonance effects are briefly considered. Again, the 2-D alternative with cylinders of mixed sizes gives thinner coatings.}

Sound waves are currently shaped using phased array systems, even though the complex electronics required are expensive and hinder widespread use. Here we show how to control, direct, and manipulate sound using 2-dimensional, planar, acoustic metasurfaces that require only one driving signal. This offers the advantages of ease of use and versatility over currently available phased arrays. We demonstrate the creation of a haptic sensation and steering of a beam produced by a parametric speaker. This simple, yet highly effective, method of creating single-beam manipulators could be introduced in medical or manufacturing applications.},

This is potentially very useful for source identification. The sphere can be acoustically transparent or it can be rigid. A rigid sphere is somewhat more practical than an open sphere. However, spherical NAH based on a rigid sphere is only valid if it can be assumed that the sphere has a negligible influence on the incident sound field, and this is not necessarily a good assumption when the sphere is very close to a radiating surface. This Letter examines the matter through simulations and experiments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider low-rank estimation of room impulse responses (RIRs). Inspired by a physics-driven room-acoustical model, we propose an estimator of RIRs that promotes a low-rank structure for a matricization, or reshaping, of the estimated RIR. This low-rank prior acts as a regularizer for the inverse problem of estimating an RIR from input-output observations, preventing overfitting and improving estimation accuracy. As directly enforcing a low rank of the estimate results is an NP-hard problem, we consider two different relaxations, one using the nuclear norm, and one using the recently introduced concept of quadratic envelopes. Both relaxations allow for implementing the proposed estimator using a first-order algorithm with convergence guarantees. When evaluated on both synthetic and recorded RIRs, it is shown that under noisy output conditions, or when the spectral excitation of the input signal is poor, the proposed estimator outperforms comparable existing methods. The performance of the two low-rank relaxations methods is similar, but the quadratic envelope has the benefit of superior robustness to the choice of regularization hyperparameter in the case when the signal-to-noise ratio is unknown. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of ordinary least squares, Tikhonov least squares, as well as the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB).},

Here, the phase behavior of the mixture of the Pluronic P65 and P105 triblock copolymer, (which have the same composition of PEO and PPO but the different molecular weight) and organic derivative, 5-methyl salicylic acid (5mS), in aqueous solution has been investigated by using small angle neutron scattering (SANS). According to the temperature and the 5mS concentration, SANS measurements showed that the P65-5mS mixtures sequentially transform into a random coil, sphere, vesicle, cylinder, and vesicle again, while the P105-5mS mixtures form spherical particles with two different sizes without any topological phase transition. Upon heating, the formation of two different kinds of the vesicle structure of amphiphilic block copolymer in aqueous solution is very unusual. This phase behavior was explained as the coupled effect of the simultaneous increase of the hydrophobicity of the polymer and the solubility of 5mS molecules upon heating. This result gives fundamental information for the practical use of Pluronic polymers in nano- and bio-science and it provides a simple route for the fabrication of the nanostructure without a complicated procedure.},

However, interaction with this mid-air content always occurred at a distance, since external objects in the display volume (e.g. user’s hands) can disturb the acoustic fields and make the particles fall. This paper proposes TipTrap, a co-located direct manipulation technique for acoustically levitated particles. TipTrap leverages the reflection of ultrasound on the users’ skin and employs a closed-loop system to create functional acoustic traps 2.1 mm below the fingertips, and addresses its 3 basic stages: selection, manipulation and deselection. We use Finite-Differences Time Domain (FDTD) simulations to explain the principles enabling TipTrap, and explore how finger reflections and user strategies influence the quality of the traps (e.g. approaching direction, orientation and tracking errors), and use these results to design our technique. We then implement the technique, characterizing its performance with a robotic hand setup and finish with an exploration of the ability of TipTrap to manipulate different types of levitated content.},

The analysis leads to stably converging results in the case of large aberration or defocus values, while the applicability of the original Nijboer–Zernike theory is limited mainly to wave-front deviations well below the value of one wavelength. Because of its intrinsic speed, the analysis is well suited to supplement or to replace numerical calculations that are currently used in the fields of (scanning) microscopy, lithography, and astronomy. In a companion paper [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A19, 860 (2002)], physical interpretations and applications in a lithographic context are presented, a convergence analysis is given, and a comparison is made with results obtained by using a numerical package.},

  abstract = {We consider 3D versions of the Zernike polynomials that are commonly used in 2D in optics and lithography. We generalize the 3D Zernike polynomials to functions that vanish to a prescribed degree \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash geq0\$ at the rim of their supporting ball \$\textbackslash rho\textbackslash leq1\$. The analytic theory of the 3D generalized Zernike functions is developed, with attention for computational results for their Fourier transform, Funk and Radon transform, and scaling operations. The Fourier transform of generalized 3D Zernike functions shows less oscillatory behaviour and more rapid decay at infinity, compared to the standard case \$\textbackslash alpha=0\$, when the smoothness parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ is increased beyond 0. The 3D generalized Zernike functions can be used to expand smooth functions, supported by the unit ball and vanishing at the rim and the origin of the unit ball, whose radial and angular dependence is separated. Particular instances of the latter functions (prewavelets) yield, via the Funk transform and the Fourier transform, an anisotropic function that can be used for a band-limited line-detecting wavelet transform, appropriate for analysis of 3D medical data containing elongated structures. We present instances of prewavelets, with relevant radial functions, that allow analytic computation of Funk and Fourier transform. A key step here is to identify the special form that is assumed by the expansion coefficients of a separable function on the unit ball with respect to generalized 3D Zernike functions. A further issue is how to scale a function on the unit ball while maintaining its supporting set, and this issue is solved in a particular form.},

  abstract = {The enhancement and detection of elongated structures in noisy image data are relevant for many biomedical imaging applications. To handle complex crossing structures in 2D images, 2D orientation scores \$\$U: \{\textbackslash mathbb \{R\}\} \^ 2\textbackslash times S \^ 1 \textbackslash rightarrow \{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}\$\$were introduced, which already showed their use in a variety of applications. Here we extend this work to 3D orientation scores \$\$U: \{\textbackslash mathbb \{R\}\} \^ 3 \textbackslash times S \^ 2\textbackslash rightarrow \{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}\$\$. First, we construct the orientation score from a given dataset, which is achieved by an invertible coherent state type of transform. For this transformation we introduce 3D versions of the 2D cake wavelets, which are complex wavelets that can simultaneously detect oriented structures and oriented edges. Here we introduce two types of cake wavelets: the first uses a discrete Fourier transform, and the second is designed in the 3D generalized Zernike basis, allowing us to calculate analytical expressions for the spatial filters. Second, we propose a nonlinear diffusion flow on the 3D roto-translation group: crossing-preserving coherence-enhancing diffusion via orientation scores (CEDOS). Finally, we show two applications of the orientation score transformation. In the first application we apply our CEDOS algorithm to real medical image data. In the second one we develop a new tubularity measure using 3D orientation scores and apply the tubularity measure to both artificial and real medical data.},

This work combines the SSMC algorithm and a fast search algorithm in order to efficiently determine decay parameters, their uncertainties, and inter-relationships with a minimum amount of required user tuning and interaction. The large variations in the posterior probability density functions over multidimensional parameter spaces imply that an adaptive exploration algorithm such as SSMC can have advantages over the exiting importance sampling Monte Carlo and Metropolis–Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. This paper discusses implementation of the SSMC algorithm, its initialization, and convergence using experimental data measured from acoustically coupled-spaces.},

The nested sampling algorithm is specifically developed to evaluate the Bayesian evidence required for determining the energy decay order with decay parameter estimates as a secondary result. Taking the energy decay analysis in architectural acoustics as an example, this paper demonstrates that two different levels of inference, decay model-selection and decay parameter estimation, can be cohesively accomplished by the nested sampling algorithm.},

Ten such models were applied to targets with simple geometric shapes and parameterized (e.g., size and material properties) to represent biological organisms such as zooplankton and fish, and their predictions of acoustic backscatter were compared to those from exact or approximate analytical models, i.e., benchmarks. These comparisons were made for a sphere, spherical shell, prolate spheroid, and finite cylinder, each with homogeneous composition. For each shape, four target boundary conditions were considered: rigid-fixed, pressure-release, gas-filled, and weakly scattering. Target strength (dB re 1 m(2)) was calculated as a function of insonifying frequency (f = 12 to 400 kHz) and angle of incidence (theta = 0 degrees to 90 degrees ). In general, the numerical models (i.e., boundary- and finite-element) matched the benchmarks over the full range of simulation parameters. While inherent errors associated with the approximate analytical models were illustrated, so were the advantages as they are computationally efficient and in certain cases, outperformed the numerical models under conditions where the numerical models did not converge.},

  abstract = {The paper describes the use of synthetic aperture (SA) imaging in medical ultrasound. SA imaging is a radical break with today’s commercial systems, where the image is acquired sequentially one image line at a time. This puts a strict limit on the frame rate and the possibility of acquiring a sufficient amount of data for high precision flow estimation. These constrictions can be lifted by employing SA imaging. Here data is acquired simultaneously from all directions over a number of emissions, and the full image can be reconstructed from this data. The paper demonstrates the many benefits of SA imaging. Due to the complete data set, it is possible to have both dynamic transmit and receive focusing to improve contrast and resolution. It is also possible to improve penetration depth by employing codes during ultrasound transmission. Data sets for vector flow imaging can be acquired using short imaging sequences, whereby both the correct velocity magnitude and angle can be estimated. A number of examples of both phantom and in vivo SA images will be presented measured by the experimental ultrasound scanner RASMUS to demonstrate the many benefits of SA imaging.},

  abstract = {Source identification in an enclosure is not an easy task due to complicated wave interference and wall reflections, in particular, at mid-high frequencies. In this study, a phased beam tracing method was applied to the reconstruction of source pressures inside an enclosure at medium frequencies. First, surfaces of an extended source are divided into reasonably small segments. From each source segment, one beam is projected into the field and all emitted beams are traced. Radiated beams from the source reach array sensors after traveling various paths including the wall reflections. Collecting all the pressure histories at the field points, source-observer relations can be constructed in a matrix-vector form for each frequency. By multiplying the measured field data with the pseudo-inverse of the calculated transfer function, one obtains the distribution of source pressure. An omni-directional sphere and a cubic source in a rectangular enclosure were taken as examples in the simulation tests. A reconstruction error was investigated by Monte Carlo simulation in terms of field point locations. When the source information was reconstructed by the present method, it was shown that the sound power of the source in an enclosure could be estimated.},

The approximation consists of integration over the monopole and dipole contributions to the force acting at each point within the region occupied by the object. The method is applied to axisymmetric objects, for which the force and torque may be expressed as a single integral along the axis of symmetry. The integral is evaluated analytically for spheres and cylinders. The accuracy of the Born approximation is assessed by comparison with complete solutions for compressible spheres and prolate spheroids that are based on expansions of the incident, scattered, and transmitted fields in terms of eigenfunctions of the corresponding separable coordinate system. Results are presented for objects with various densities and compressibilities relative to the surrounding fluid, as well as different shapes, sizes, and orientations of the object with respect to the standing wave field. The method also accommodates spatial variations of the density and compressibility within the object.},

In the present paper, ABHs are used to reduce the noise inside a cavity bounded by a flexible plate with multiple two-dimensional (2-D) ABH indentations. The interior sound field is generated by and fully coupled to the vibration of the flexible plate subject to a point force excitation. A refined numerical finite element model considering the plate-cavity coupling is established and validated by experiments. Both the simulation and experimental results show a significant noise reduction inside the cavity in a relatively wide frequency range through embedding the 2-D ABHs into the flexible plate. Analyses on the underlying mechanisms show a dual physical process of the ABH effects: the first being the direct consequence of the vibration reduction of the plate as a result of ABH-induced damping enhancement, whilst the second one being caused by a reduction in the coupling strength between the plate and the cavity. This ABH-specific decoupling phenomenon is characterized by the spatial coupling coefficients, which depend on the degree of morphological matching between structural modes and acoustic modes over the plate-cavity interface. The reported phenomenon of the impaired structural-acoustic coupling reveals a new ABH-specific feature which enriches the existing knowledge on ABH structures.},

Coupling multiple different resonant unit cells has been an effective strategy to achieve a broadband sound absorption. In this paper, we report on an analytical, numerical and experimental study of a low-frequency broadband (50–63~Hz, one third octave band), high absorption (average absorption coefficient ≈93\%), near-omnidirectional (0–75°) acoustic metasurface absorber composed of four coupled unit cells at a thickness of 15.4~cm (1/45 of the wavelength at 50~Hz). To further broaden the bandwidth (50–100~Hz, one octave band), a design with 19 unit cells coupled in a supercell is analytically studied to achieve an average absorption coefficient of 85\% for a wide angle range (0–75°) at a thickness of 20~cm (1/34 of wavelength at 50~Hz). Two additional degrees of freedom, the lateral size of supercell and the number of unit cells in the supercell, are demonstrated to facilitate such a causally optimal design which is close to the ideally causal optimality. The proposed design methodology may solve the long-standing issue for low frequency absorption in room acoustics.},

Here, we demonstrate a novel method for on-chip generation and manipulation of HOPBs through combining metasurface with optical waveguides on lithium niobate on insulator platform. With phase modulation by a diatomic geometric metasurface, guided waves are extracted into free space with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the form of two orthogonal circularly polarized optical vortices which are linearly superposed into HOPBs. Meanwhile, a dual-port waveguide crossing is established to reconfigure the output states into an arbitrary point on a higher-order Poincaré sphere based on in-plane interference of two guided waves. Our approach provides a promising solution to generate and manipulate the HOPBs in a compact manner, which would be further enhanced by employing the electro-optical modulation on a lithium niobate waveguide to access a fully tunable scheme.}

  abstract = {This study proposes an alternative to the classic wedge design for anechoic chambers, which is the uniform-then-gradient, flat-wall (UGFW) structure. The working mechanisms of the proposed structure and the traditional wedge are analyzed. It is found that their absorption patterns are different. The parameters of both structures are optimized for achieving minimum absorber depth, under the condition of absorbing 99\% of normal incident sound energy. It is found that, the UGFW structure achieves a smaller total depth for the cut-off frequencies ranging from 100Hz to 250Hz. This paper also proposes a modification for the complex source image (CSI) model for the empirical simulation of anechoic chambers, originally proposed by Bonfiglio et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 134 (1), 285–291 (2013)]. The modified CSI model considers the non-locally reactive effect of absorbers at oblique incidence, and the improvement is verified by a full, finite-element simulation of a small chamber. With the modified CSI model, the performance of both decorations with the optimized parameters in a large chamber is simulated. The simulation results are analyzed and checked against the tolerance of 1.5dB deviation from the inverse square law, stipulated in the ISO standard 3745(2003). In terms of the total decoration depth and anechoic chamber performance, the UGFW structure is better than the classic wedge design.},

It attracts extensive interest owing to its substantial advantage in engineering detection and biomedical science. However, the conventional focusing technique leads to the undesirable off-target influence in the nonfocusing region, hindering its application such as ultrasound surgery. Here we propose an ultrasound beam with idiosyncratic sharp autofocusing properties and implement it with the binary metasurface. The beam shows a sharp accumulation at the focus with an abrupt increase of intensity by three orders of magnitude while keeping the unintended region intact. The sharp autofocusing is realized by the controlled transverse self-acceleration and collapse of caustic at the focus in a nonlinear fashion. The intensity contrast, width, and position of the beam are highly tunable to realize the freewheeling focusing with high efficiency. Remarkably, the possibility to synthesize the abrupt autofocusing by the phase-only modulation is revealed. As an implementation, we demonstrate that the precise control of the sharp converging beam can be realized by an extremely simple metasurface with binary elements. The sharp autofocusing beams would open an avenue to realize the diverse ultrasound focusing with promising applications in medical ultrasound imaging, therapy, and nondestructive evaluation.},

A sound power level solution method for sound intensity scaling suitable for complex environments is verified in this paper. The depth of the sound source is determined by dual arrays. The sound wave propagation and superposition characteristics are used to establish an optimized objective function, to optimize the strength of the target sound source and remove the noise components. Finally, the sound power level of the sound sources after noise reductions are calculated by the sound intensity scaling method. In the semi-anechoic room, white noise signal and impact signal are used as interference noise in the experiments. The results show that this method can effectively reduce the noise of the signal in the noisy environment and improve the calculation accuracy of the sound power level of the sound source. The error of the sound power level calculation results under the influence of white noise and impact noise has been greatly reduced after optimization. The calculation error of sound power level decreased from 3.2 dB–12.2 dB to 0.2 dB–5dB.},

  abstract = {[EN] Vortex beams, characterized by a collimated wavefront with a phase dislocation at their principal axis, have found practical applications to construct acoustic tweezers for particle trapping and manipulation, or underwater communications. However, the natural diffraction of the wavefront limits the size of the vortex. This result in vortices whose bright core is larger than the wavelength, limiting their use for practical applications such as long-range underwater communications. In this work, we synthesize a vortex beam of sub-wavelength size at a distance beyond Rayleigh diffraction length using the nonlinear mixing of two confocal, high-frequency and detuned vortex beams of different topological charges. By using the nonlinear mixing of two confocal vortices, it was generated a low-frequency (1 kHz) focused vortex beam of integer topological charge whose distance between magnitude maxima is about 18 times smaller than its wavelength at a distance about 3 times the Rayleigh diffraction length. Sub-wavelength vortices emerge as a result of the spatiotemporal interference of two primary vortex beams due to the conservation of angular momentum during nonlinear wave-mixing. This mechanism opens new paths to design directive parametric antennas for vortex transceivers or particle manipulation systems at scales well below the diffraction limit.},

The intensity distribution rotates along the beam axis with controlled direction and angular frequency, resembling in this way the shape of a mechanical drill bit. Acoustic drill beams emerge as the spatiotemporal interference of two confocal, detuned vortex beams. The beam parameters are fully tuneable. The detuned frequency, the detuned wavenumber and the detuned topological charge of the composing beams can be tuned to control the drill parameters such as the number of drill arms, the winding period, the rotational speed, and their direction. We show that elongated drill beams are obtained using two confocal high-order Bessel beams, allowing analytical solutions for optimal overlap. In addition, drill beams can also be synthesised using focused ultrasound vortices. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results are shown in the ultrasound regime using a low-cost device based on two 1-MHz confocal piezoelectric transducers and 3D printed acoustic holograms.

  abstract = {[ES] El tratamiento de enfermedades neurológicas está muy limitado por la ineficiente penetración de los fármacos en el tejido cerebral dañado debido a la barrera hematoencefálica (BHE), lo que imposibilita mejorar la salud del paciente. La BHE es un mecanismo de protección natural para evitar la difusión de agentes potencialmente peligrosas para el sistema nervioso central. No obstante, la BHE se puede inhibir mediante ultrasonidos focalizados e inyección de microburbujas de forma segura, localizada y transitoria, una tecnología empleada mundialmente. La principal ventaja es su carácter no invasivo, siendo así muy atractiva y cómoda para el paciente. Normalmente, la zona cerebral enferma se trata en su parte central empleando un único foco. Sin embargo, enfermedades como el Alzheimer o el Parkinson requieren un tratamiento sobre estructuras de geometría compleja y tamaño elevado, situadas en ambos hemisferios cerebrales. Por tanto, la tecnología actual está muy limitada al no cumplir dichos requisitos. Esta tesis doctoral tiene como objetivo el desarrollo de una técnica novedosa, basada en hologramas acústicos, para resolver las limitaciones presentes en los tratamientos neurológicos empleando ultrasonidos. Se estudian las lentes acústicas holográficas impresas en 3D, que acopladas a un transductor mono-elemento, permiten el control preciso del frente de onda ultrasónico tanto para (1) compensar las distorsiones que sufre el haz hasta alcanzar el cerebro, como (2) focalizarlo simultáneamente en regiones múltiples y de geometría compleja o formando de vórtices acústicos, proporcionando así efectividad en tiempo y coste. Por ello, la investigación desarrollada en esta tesis abre un camino prometedor en el campo de la biomedicina que permitirá mejorar los tratamientos neurológicos, además de aplicaciones en neuroestimulación o ablación térmica del tejido.},

This approach finds the solution to the Helmholtz equation that is closest to the desired soundfield in a weighted least squares sense. The basis orthogonal set is formed using QR factorization with as input a suitable set of solutions of the Helmholtz equation. The coefficients of the Helmholtz solution wavefields can then be calculated, reducing the multizone sound reproduction problem to the reconstruction of a set of basis wavefields over the desired region. The method facilitates its application with a more practical loudspeaker configuration. The approach is shown effective for both accurately reproducing sound in the selected bright zone and minimizing sound leakage into the predefined quiet zone.},

  abstract = {A general Chebyshev–Lagrangian method is proposed to obtain the analytical solution for a rectangular acoustic cavity with arbitrary impedance boundary conditions. The originality of the present paper is the successful attempt of applying orthogonal polynomials, such as Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, to the analysis of a rectangular sound field with general wall impedance. The sound pressure is uniformly expressed as triplicate Chebyshev polynomial series which is independent in each direction. The Chebyshev polynomial series solution is obtained using the Rayleigh–Ritz procedure after considering the influence of boundary impedance on the cavity as the work done by the impedance surfaces in the Lagrangian function. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed method are validated against the analytical solutions and some numerical results available in the literature. Excellent orthogonality and complete properties of the Chebyshev polynomials ensure the rapid convergence, numerical stability, high accuracy of the current solution. The simplicity and low computational cost of the present approach make it preferable to obtain the results of complex models even in the relative high frequency range by choosing enough truncated terms in the sound pressure expression. Numerous cases with various uniform or non-uniform impedance boundary conditions are analyzed numerically and some of the results can be used as benchmark. It is shown that the impedance boundary condition can effectively influence or modify the acoustic characteristics and response of a cavity.},

Artificial diffusion is applied in the numerical implementation to suppress oscillations of the solution.

In general, they are in good agreement, and the transport equation models are substantially less time consuming. In addition, the two-group model is found to yield more accurate results than the one-group model for the tested cases. Lastly, acoustic experimental results obtained from a 1:10 long room scale-model are used to verify the transport equation models. The results suggest that the transport equation models are able to accurately model the sound field in a long space.},

  abstract = {A k-space method for moderately nonlinear wave propagation in absorptive media is presented. The Westervelt equation is first transferred into k-space via Fourier transformation, and is solved by a modified wave-vector time-domain scheme. The present approach is not limited to forward propagation or parabolic approximation. One- and two-dimensional problems are investigated to verify the method by comparing results to analytic solutions and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. It is found that to obtain accurate results in homogeneous media, the grid size can be as little as two points per wavelength, and for a moderately nonlinear problem, the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number can be as large as 0.4. Through comparisons with the conventional FDTD method, the k-space method for nonlinear wave propagation is shown here to be computationally more efficient and accurate. The k-space method is then employed to study three-dimensional nonlinear wave propagation through the skull, which shows that a relatively accurate focusing can be achieved in the brain at a high frequency by sending a low frequency from the transducer. Finally, implementations of the k-space method using a single graphics processing unit shows that it required about one-seventh the computation time of a single-core CPU calculation.},

  abstract = {A new method has been developed to predict acoustic scattering by weakly scattering objects with three-dimensional variability in sound speed and density. This variability can take the form of inhomogeneities within the body of the scatterer and/or geometries where the acoustic wave passes through part of the scattering body, into the surrounding medium, and back into the body. This method applies the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) using a numerical approach that rigorously accounts for the phase changes within a scattering volume. Ranges of validity with respect to material properties and numerical considerations are first explored through comparisons with modal-series-based predictions of scattering by fluid-filled spherical and cylindrical fluid shells. The method is then applied to squid and incorporates high resolution spiral computerized tomography (SCT) scans of the complex morphology of the organism. Target strength predictions based on the SCT scans are compared with published backscattering data from live, freely swimming and tethered squid. The new method shows significant improvement for both single-orientation and orientation-averaged scattering predictions over the DWBA-homogeneous-prolate-spheroid model.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the active control of harmonic enclosed sound fields, special emphasis being given to the low and high frequency limits. A general statistical approach is adopted which seeks to quantify the performance of some well known active control strategies by specifying the mean acoustic potential energy reduction and, where possible, the variance about the mean. This paper is divided into two parts. The first deals with the active control of harmonic enclosed sound fields at low frequencies where the frequency response function is composed of distinct, well isolated modal resonances. In this frequency regime the sound field in the room is amenable to global control: for example, minimizing the total acoustic potential energy in the enclosure. At the resonance frequency of the dominant mode, substantial reductions in sound pressure level are readily achieved throughout the enclosure. At much higher frequencies, however, the response of the room is not dominated by a single mode, but rather the contributions from a much larger number of modes of roughly equal amplitude. In this frequency range, the complete suppression of the dominant mode, or of a small number of dominant modes, does not afford significant reductions in the average sound pressure level of the sound field. In this instance such a global approach to active control is obviously ineffective and one must resort to local control schemes. This paper is concerned with the effect of cancelling the pressure at a single point remote from the sources, the result of which is to produce a small localized zone of quiet centred on the point of cancellation. Experimental measurements of this quiet zone are presented together with an analysis of the secondary source strength statistics. Also presented in this paper is an expression for the distribution of the acoustic potential energy after control as the source and cancellation positions are varied randomly around the room.},

An active headrest system is combined with the remote microphone technique so that direct measurement of the error signals at the listener’s ears are not necessary. The formulation of the optimal observation filter for the remote microphone technique and the optimal controller for active control is presented in the time domain, to sense and control broadband random road noise. The estimation accuracy of the remote microphone technique is investigated through simulations, using the signals measured at a number of monitoring microphones and error microphones in the cabin of a large SUV. It is shown that disturbances at the virtual error microphones can be accurately estimated by a causal observation filter. The attenuation performance of the active headrest system using the remote microphone technique is also predicted offline, using measured plant responses, disturbance signals and reference signals, which shows that several peaks in the spectrum of the road noise can be reduced at frequencies of up to 1 kHz. The effects of delays and head movements on the attenuation performance are also studied.},

While it is desired to combine the information captured by a grid of densely arranged RSMAs for expanding the area of accurate reconstruction, or sweet-spots, this is not trivial due to inter-array interference. Here, we propose multiple scattering ambisonics, a method for three-dimensional ambisonics sound field recording using multiple acoustically interacting RSMAs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the sweet-spot expansion realized by the proposed method. The proposed method can be used with existing RSMAs as building blocks and opens possibilities including higher degrees-of-freedom spatial audio. VC 2021 Author(s).

Instead of using a real rectangular plane source, the equivalent sources that have complex amplitudes in complex space are used to compute the sound field distribution. The parabolic equation first is solved in the k-space domain by applying Fourier transform. The k-space domain source is then expressed as a set of Gaussian functions, and the related coefficients is determined by the optimization method. The analytic solution then is derived, and the effect of the parameters on the calculation accuracy is discussed. The comparison between the proposed fast numerical scheme and previous methods (Fresnel integral and Ocheltree’s method) and are given in an example. The numerical results reveal that the computation time in obtaining accurate calculations is greatly reduced by using the proposed method.},

In this paper, we demonstrate power transfer through a metal wall with the use of ultrasonic waves generated from a piezoelectric transducer. Accurate characterization and modeling of the transducer and investigation of the influence of the acoustic properties of the transmitting medium are instrumental for the performance prediction and optimal design of an ultrasonic power link. In this work, we applied the KLM model for the emitting and receiving transducers, with respect to the transmitting medium and model for both the emission and reception function. A practical UPT system was built by mechanically coupling and co-axially aligning two composite transducers on opposite sides of a transmitting medium wall. The optimal transmission performance of the ultrasonic power link through thickness-stretch vibrations of the wall together with two piezoelectric transducers working in TE mode was determined. Eventually, the operating frequency and ohmic loading condition for maximum power transmission were obtained for two different media, aluminium and polyoxymethylene (POM), with contrasting specific acoustic impedances. The results showed that the measured optimal electric loads and operating frequency for maximum power transfer agreed well with the theoretical predictions.},

The numerical results are correctly predicted by the WKB analysis above a certain frequency. In general, this frequency is shown to fall as the order of the WKB analysis approximation is increased, but at least a second-order WKB approximation is required in the working frequency range. The total reflection coefficient depends not only on the practical truncation of the wedge but also on the discontinuity between the wedge and the plate to which it is attached. Interference between these two sources of reflection causes ripples in the total reflection coefficient. Apart from the usual power-law profile, alternative thickness variations are also considered. Limitations on the applicability of the analytical method are illustrated through a wedge whose thickness varies predominantly away from the junction between the wedge and the uniform plate.},

  abstract = {Tapered elastic wedges can be used to control flexural vibrations and this article explores a method of enhancing the performance of such terminations using multiple wedges. A system design where a uniform beam is terminated by multiple quadratically tapered wedges of different lengths is proposed, aiming to enhance the absorption of flexural vibrations. An analytical method based on the exact solution of the non-uniform one-dimensional Euler–Bernoulli beam is used to analyse this system, with the additional assumptions that the moments and forces at the junction from the side of the beam are balanced by the sums of the moments and forces of the wedges. The analytical model is compared with Finite Element simulations and its range of validity is discussed. Differences arise between the analytical and numerical results due to torsional effects, however, it is shown that a trident-shaped configuration can be used to suppress the effect of torsion. Simulations using the analytical model show that for the proposed multiple-wedge termination, more frequency bands of very low reflection, and thus very high absorption, appear compared to single-wedge terminations. Such bands of low reflection also occur at lower frequencies, where the absorptive capability of a single wedge is limited. An analysis of the zeros of the reflection coefficient in the complex-frequency plane is used to investigate the enhanced absorption through the concept of critical coupling. This analysis shows that the multiple-wedge termination leads to richer modal content due to the modal coupling between the wedges of different lengths, and that for appropriate length combinations very little damping can give very high absorption at certain frequencies. The proposed design thus provides significant enhancement of absorptive behaviour compared to a single-wedge termination.},

Active split-ring resonators loaded with varactor diodes are demonstrated theoretically to act as phase-conjugating or time-reversing discrete elements when parametrically pumped and illuminated with appropriate frequencies. The metamaterial elements were fabricated and shown experimentally to produce a time-reversed signal. Measurements confirm that a discrete array of phase-conjugating elements act as a negatively refracting time-reversal rf lens only 0.12λ thick.},

  abstract = {The effect of temperature on the micellar morphology of two polystyrene-b-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PS-b-PNIPAM) diblock copolymers in an aqueous solution was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At 25 degrees C, a mixture of vesicles and spheres are observed for the micelles of PS65-b-PNIPAM108, while PS65-b-PNIPAM360 exhibits mixed cylindrical and spherical micellar morphology. Upon increasing the temperature, the micellar morphology becomes spherical for PS65-b-PNIPAM108 at 60 degrees C and for PS65-b-PNIPAM360 at 40 degrees C. Such vesicle-to-sphere and cylinder-to-sphere transitions of micellar morphology are reversible when the micellar solutions are cooled back to 25 degrees C. However, these temperature-induced morphological transitions of the PS-b-PNIPAM micelles are contrary to the theoretical prediction. Qualitative analysis of the free energy shows that vesicular or cylindrical micelles tend to form at higher temperatures if only the overall volume change of the PNIPAM block is considered. The contradiction between the experimental results and theoretical prediction is interpreted in terms of the local deformability of the PNIPAM chains. At elevated temperatures, the collapsed PNIPAM globules are less deformable and must occupy larger areas at the micellar interface, although the overall volume is smaller at higher temperatures. This will lead to a larger repulsion between the PNIPAM globules and a remarkable increase in the free energy of the corona; thus, the formation of vesicles or cylinders at higher temperatures is prohibited.},

Time-space decomposition analytically separates the temporal and spatial components of a rapidly converging single integral expression, thereby converting transient nearfield pressure calculations into the superposition of a small number of fast-converging spatial integrals that are weighted by time-dependent factors. Results indicate that, for the same peak error value, time-space decomposition is at least one or two orders of magnitude faster than the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral, the Schoch integral, the Field II program, and the DREAM program. Time-space decomposition is also faster than methods that directly calculate the impulse response by at least a factor of 3 for a 10\% peak error and by a factor of 17 for a 1\% peak error. The results show that, for a specified maximum error value, time-space decomposition is significantly faster than the impulse response and other analytical integrals evaluated for computations of transient nearfield pressures generated by circular pistons.},

The multipath fields are studied as solutions to the wave equation in an infinite-dimensional vector space. We prove two universal upper bounds on the truncation error of fixed and random multipath fields. A direct consequence of the derived bounds is that both fixed and random multipath fields have an effective finite dimension. For circular and spherical spatial regions, we show that this finite dimension is proportional to the radius and area of the region, respectively. We use the Karhunen-Loegraveve (KL) expansion of random multipath fields to quantify the notion of multipath richness. The multipath richness is defined as the number of significant eigenvalues in the KL expansion that achieve 99\% of the total multipath energy. We establish a lower bound on the largest eigenvalue. This lower bound quantifies, to some extent, the well-known reduction of multipath richness with reducing the angular power spread of multipath angular power spectrum},

The weighted sound reduction index (SRI) was found to rapidly degrade as the slit width increased, and unfavorable deviations between the measured curve and the reference curve based on ISO 717-1 appeared mainly around the first resonance frequency of the slit. In terms of the weighted SRI, the values predicted by Gomperts’ theory have a good one-to-one correspondence with the measured values and are accurate to within 2 dB (average 0.7 dB).},

The procedure adopted may be used to study the effect of viscosity on the characteristics of the radiation field. While having little effect on the field in the neighborhood of an oscillator generating waves in water, the viscosity has a marked effect on the range of distant transmission, which in consequence is appreciably affected by temperature. Of considerable practical importance is the existence of an optimum wave-length for constant output and a given distance of transmission. By means of a simple chart, it is possible to determine the optimum wave-length for a given transmitter when the level of reception for a given range is stated.},

  abstract = {A number of factors influence the accuracy of estimation of source volume with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. This study investigated the role of a number of factors including system spatial resolution (which includes the influence of low-pass filters applied to suppress noise), source size and shape, and voxel size in determining volume. A rectangular parallelepiped (bar), a right cylinder, and a sphere were mathematically modeled as being imaged with a SPECT system by calculating the three-dimensional (3-D) convolution of them with symmetric Gaussian functions of 20 different full widths at half maximums (FWHM's). The resulting activity profiles were analyzed to determine the location of the edges as a function of the source size relative to the FWHM of the system. The edge definition criteria studied were (1) the location of the 50\% count threshold and (2) the maximum in the local gradient. In addition, the threshold which yielded the correct edge location was also determined. A nonstationary computer simulation of SPECT imaging, based on the serial model of the system transfer function, was used to test the predictions of the mathematical model and investigate the influence of (1) voxel size and sampling with a discrete array of voxels; (2) attenuation; (3) scatter; (4) variable spatial resolution; (5) low-pass filtering; and (6) noise. The mathematical model predicted that both the 50\% threshold and the maximum in the local gradient methods of estimating edge location would show either an under- or overestimate of source volume depending on both the ratio of source diameter to system FWHM and the source shape.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This substantially reduces the number of elements in the 2-D array. Modeled data are used to compare RCA arrays in pulse-echo mode to fully populated 2-D arrays for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) applications and an improved beamforming algorithm based on the total focusing method is tested. Improved beamforming has led to a less than half-wavelength diameter conical bottom hole being successfully detected experimentally using an RCA array, with a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 17.0 dB (3.s.f). The average difference between the -6-dB drop width and the nominal drill bit diameter when sizing flat bottom holes experimentally using RCA arrays is also improved compared to plane B-scan algorithms from (1.29 ± 0.07) mm to (0.23 ± 0.04) mm. These developments demonstrate the advantages of using RCA arrays over conventional fully populated 2-D arrays and provide a basis for their use, and development, in the field of NDE.},

  abstract = {Solutions for frequency-invariant beamforming with concentric circular arrays are used in many applications, including microphone arrays and audio communication. However, existing methods focus on the azimuth-beamwidth and consider uniformly spaced circular arrays. This paper presents an approach to designing a constant elevation-beamwidth beamformer for nonuniform concentric ring arrays. The suggested beamformer aims to maximize the array directivity factor while maintaining fixed beamwidth over a wide range of frequencies. The introduced methodology simultaneously selects the ring placements and designs the beamformer weights that achieve optimal performance. We present the problem constraints and cost function, resulting in a sparse beamformer design. In addition, a uniformly spaced beamformer is incorporated into the optimization cost function to attain improved performance. Time-domain implementation of the ideal beamformer is also presented in this work. Furthermore, in the proposed array configuration, all sensors on each ring share the same weight value. Thus, the computational complexity and the physical hardware required in a physical setup are significantly reduced. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the nonuniform beamformer compared to a uniform beamformer in terms of directivity index, white noise gain, and sidelobe attenuation.},

  abstract = {Exceptional points (EP) are non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce1–4. Recently, EPs have attracted attention as a means to enhance the responsivity of sensors, through the abrupt resonant detuning occurring in their proximity5–20. In many cases, however, the EP implementation is accompanied by noise enhancement, leading to the degradation of the sensor’s performance15–20. The excess noise can be of fundamental nature (owing to the eigenbasis collapse) or of technical nature associated with the amplification mechanisms utilized for the realization of EPs. Here we show, using an EP-based parity–time symmetric21,22 electromechanical accelerometer, that the enhanced technical noise can be surpassed by the enhanced responsivity to applied accelerations. The noise owing to eigenbasis collapse is mitigated by exploiting the detuning from a transmission peak degeneracy (TPD) — which forms when the sensor is weakly coupled to transmission lines — as a measure of the sensitivity. These TPDs occur at a frequency and control parameters for which the biorthogonal eigenbasis is still complete and are distinct from the EPs of the parity–time symmetric sensor. Our device shows a threefold signal-to-noise-ratio enhancement compared with configurations for which the system operates away from the TPD.},

PT symmetry started out in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where complex potentials obeying PT symmetry could exhibit all-real spectra. This concept later spread out to optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, electronic circuits, and many other physical fields, where a judicious balancing of gain and loss constitutes a PT-symmetric system. The natural inclusion of nonlinearity into these PT systems then gave rise to a wide array of new phenomena which have no counterparts in traditional dissipative systems. Examples include the existence of continuous families of nonlinear modes and integrals of motion, stabilization of nonlinear modes above PT-symmetry phase transition, symmetry breaking of nonlinear modes, distinctive soliton dynamics, and many others. In this article, nonlinear PT-symmetric systems arising from various physical disciplines are presented, nonlinear properties of these systems are thoroughly elucidated, and relevant experimental results are described. In addition, emerging applications of PT symmetry are pointed out.},

Most of the experiments conducted previously have operated under conditions of predominantly nearfield generation. An experiment is described that is tailored to examine the parametric radiator where the bulk of the generation occurs in the farfield. The experimental source levels and beam patterns are found to be in close agreement with the Mellen‐Moffett model of the radiator. For some conditions, the beamwidth of the difference frequency is in fact narrower than that of the primary pattern and approaches the square of the primary pattern, a result predicted by the model. The application of the model is illustrated by examples of both near‐and farfield generation parametric sources.},

Indeed such systems provide an exciting alternative for communication. Here we introduce information transfer through free-space using a laser beam having its phase encoded with multiple orthogonal aberration modes. We use Zernike polynomials, which form a complete basis set, to represent the aberration modes. The user information is converted to co-efficients of the Zernike modes which are summed digitally to obtain the resultant phase profile. A single phase modulating device then reads the resultant phase to shape the wavefront of the beam to be transmitted. The receiving station estimates the co-efficients of all modes in the beam from a single measurement of a wavefront sensor, to retrieve the user information. We demonstrate data transfer using multiple modes, each with multiple strengths, and external perturbation compensation using the completeness property of the modes.},

An axially symmetric phantom consisting of a cylinder with a sphere is imaged with either the cylinder or the sphere containing 99mTc. An iterative peak-erosion algorithm and a fitting algorithm are given and employed to analyze the acquired spectra. Adequate separation into an unscattered component and a Compton-scattered component is judged on the basis of filtered-backprojection reconstruction of corrected projections. In the reconstructions, attenuation correction is based on the known geometry and the total attenuation cross section for water. An independent test of the accuracy of separation is not made. For both algorithms, reconstructed slices for the cold-sphere, hot-surround phantom have the correct shape as confirmed by simulation results that take into account the measured dependence of system resolution on depth. For the inverse phantom, a hot sphere in a cold surround, quantitative results with the fitting algorithm are accurate but with a particular number of iterations of the erosion algorithm are less good. (A greater number of iterations would improve the 26\% error with the algorithm, however.) These preliminary results encourage us to believe that a method for correcting for Compton-scattering in a wide variety of objects can be found, thus helping to achieve quantitative SPECT.},

The quantification is relative to a known-activity reference source. The scatter multiplier ("k" value) is determined for a radioactive 99mTc sphere on or off the axis of a cylinder containing water with or without background. Both maximum likelihood and filtered-backprojection reconstruction are employed. Either projections or tomograms are corrected. With tight regions of interest, there is a tendency for the requisite "k" value to be slightly lower as the diameter of the cylinder is increased. Neither sphere location nor background perturbs "k", however, so a constant value is a good, first approximation. Then a two-sphere validation test yields an accuracy of 8\% with subtracted-tomograms ("k" = 1.30) and 2\% with subtracted-projections ("k" = 1.20). With a reference-source region of interest which is four times larger, "k" is reduced and also now depends on background. Although equivalent quantitatively, maximum likelihood is preferable to filtered backprojection with Chang attenuation correction since it produces a less-noisy image.},

A scatter fraction, defined as total scattered over total unscattered counts within a 20\% window, is calculated for each point in our Anger camera images. These scatter fractions are tested against those from Monte-Carlo simulation for 99mTc and against results from semiconductor detector measurements for 131I. A radioactive sphere at several locations within a non-radioactive cylinder and the inverse are imaged for the testing. For one case, reproducibility of the spectral-fitting scatter fraction as a function of the number of unscattered counts within the 20\% acceptance window was also determined. With 99mTc, for all cases, the agreement between spectral fitting and the standard estimation method is within 16\%. With 131I, for the 'hot' sphere at two locations, the agreement is within 21\%. For the 'hot' sphere at the third location (off the cylinder axis towards the camera), the dependence of scatter fraction on transverse distance is good although the absolute values are too large. Scatter fraction reproducibility is within 10\% for 1000 or more counts. Therefore, further testing of spectral fitting and initial application to realistic clinical images seem to be in order.},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture sequential beamforming (SASB) is a novel technique which allows to implement synthetic aperture beamforming on a system with a restricted complexity, and without storing RF-data. The objective is to improve lateral resolution and obtain a more depth independent resolution compared to conventional ultrasound imaging. SASB is a two-stage procedure using two separate beamformers. The initial step is to construct and store a set of B-mode image lines using a single focal point in both transmit and receive. The focal points are considered virtual sources and virtual receivers making up a virtual array. The second stage applies the focused image lines from the first stage as input data, and take advantage of the virtual array in the delay and sum beamforming. The size of the virtual array is dynamically expanded and the image is dynamically focused in both transmit and receive and a range independent lateral resolution is obtained. The SASB method has been investigated using simulations in Field II and by off-line processing of data acquired with a commercial scanner. The lateral resolution increases with a decreasing F\#. Grating lobes appear if F\#⩽2 for a linear array with λ-pitch. The performance of SASB with the virtual source at 20mm and F\#=1.5 is compared with conventional dynamic receive focusing (DRF). The axial resolution is the same for the two methods. For the lateral resolution there is improvement in FWHM of at least a factor of 2 and the improvement at −40dB is at least a factor of 3. With SASB the resolution is almost constant throughout the range. For DRF the FWHM increases almost linearly with range and the resolution at −40dB is fluctuating with range. The theoretical potential improvement in SNR of SASB over DRF has been estimated. An improvement is attained at the entire range, and at a depth of 80mm the improvement is 8dB.},

The processing, based on the spherical harmonics decomposition, is performed in order to investigate the radial-dependent spherical functions and extract their argument – distance to the source. Using the low-frequency approximation of these functions, the source distance is explicitly expressed. The source distance is also determined from the original equation (using no approximation) by comparing both sides of this equation. The applicability of both methods is first presented in the noise-less data simulation, then validated with data contaminated by the additive white noise of different signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, both methods are tested for real data measured by a rigid spherical microphone array of radius 0.15m, consisting of 36 microphones for a point source represented by a small speaker. The possibility of determination of the source distance using low-order spherical harmonics is shown.},

Two established methods are incorporated: acoustical radiosity, accounting for the diffuse part, and the image source method, accounting for the specular part. The model is based on conservation of acoustical energy. Losses are taken into account by the energy absorption coefficient, and the diffuse reflections are controlled via the scattering coefficient, which defines the portion of energy that has been diffusely reflected. The way the model is formulated allows for a dynamic control of the image source production, so that no fixed maximum reflection order is required. The model is optimized for energy impulse response predictions in arbitrary polyhedral rooms. The predictions are validated by comparison with published measured data for a real music studio hall. The proposed model turns out to be promising for acoustic predictions providing a high level of detail and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Active acoustic metamaterials are one path to acoustic properties difficult to realize with passive structures, especially for broadband applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 2D metamaterial composed of coupled sensor-driver unit cells with effective bulk modulus ( 𝜅 eff κeff ) precisely tunable through adjustments of the amplitude and phase of the transfer function between pairs of sensors and drivers present in each cell. This work adopts the concepts of our previous theoretical study on polarized sources to realize acoustic metamaterials in which the active unit cells are strongly interacting with each other. To demonstrate the capability of our active metamaterial to produce on-demand negative, fractional, and large  𝜅 eff κeff , we matched the scattered field from an incident pulse measured in a 2D waveguide with the sound scattered by equivalent continuous materials obtained in numerical simulations. Our approach benefits from being highly scalable, as the unit cells are independently controlled and any number of them can be arranged to form arbitrary geometries without added computational complexity.},

We propose a method for transforming these signals by using planar or linear arrays of microphones and loudspeakers. A continuous transform equation is analytically derived based on the physical equation of wave propagation in the spatio-temporal frequency domain. By introducing spatial sampling, the uniquely determined transform filter, called a wave field reconstruction filter (WFR filter), is derived. Numerical simulations show that the WFR filter can achieve the same performance as that obtained using the conventional least squares (LS) method. However, since the proposed WFR filter is represented as a spatial convolution, it has many advantages in filter design, filter size, computational cost, and filter stability over the transform filter designed by the LS method.},

We find a surprising connection between quasicrystals and topological phases of matter: (i) quasicrystals exhibit nontrivial topological properties and (ii) these properties are attributed to dimensions higher than that of the quasicrystal. Specifically, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that one-dimensional quasicrystals are assigned two-dimensional Chern numbers and, respectively, exhibit topologically protected boundary states equivalent to the edge states of a two-dimensional quantum Hall system. We harness the topological nature of these states to adiabatically pump light across the quasicrystal. We generalize our results to higher-dimensional systems and other topological indices. Hence, quasicrystals offer a new platform for the study of topological phases while their topology may better explain their surface properties.},

The mechanism for perceiving near-range echoes is not known. This paper models the direct mouth-to-ear signal (MES) and the echo to show that the echo enhances the high-frequency components in the composite MES/echo signal with features that allow echolocation. The mouth emission beam narrows with increasing frequency and exhibits frequency-dependent transmission notches in the backward direction toward the ears as predicted by the piston-in-sphere model. The ears positioned behind the mouth detect a MES that contains predominantly the low frequencies contained in the emission. Hence the high-frequency components in the emission that are perceived by the ears are enhanced by the echoes. A pulse/echo audible sonar verifies this model by echolocating targets from 5 cm range, where the MES and echo overlap significantly, to 55 cm. The model predicts that unambiguous ranging occurs over a limited range and that there is an optimal range that produces the highest range resolution.},

This paper presents a deep learning method for grid-free source characterization using a Transformer architecture that is exclusively trained with simulated data. Unlike previous grid-free model architectures, the presented approach requires a single model to characterize an unknown number of ground-truth sources. The model predicts a set of source components, spatially arranged in clusters. Integration over the predicted cluster components allows for the determination of the strength for each ground-truth source individually. Fast and accurate source mapping performance of up to ten sources at different frequencies is demonstrated and strategies to reduce the training effort at neighboring frequencies are given. A comparison with the established grid-based CLEAN-SC and a probabilistic sparse Bayesian learning method on experimental data emphasizes the validity of the approach.},

The spherical array has been widely used for far-field source localization due to ease of array processing in spherical harmonics domain. Various methods for far-field source localization has been reformulated in spherical harmonics domain. However, near-field source localization that involves joint estimation of range and bearing of the sources has hitherto not been investigated. In this paper, the near-field data model is developed in spherical harmonics domain. In particular, three methods that jointly estimate the range and bearing of multiple sources in the spherical array framework are proposed. Two subspace-based methods called the Spherical Harmonic MUltiple SIgnal Classification (SH-MUSIC) and the Spherical Harmonics MUSIC-Group Delay (SH-MGD) for near-field source localization are first presented. In addition, a method for near-field source localization and beamforming using Spherical Harmonic MVDR (SH-MVDR) is also formulated. Formulation and analysis of Cramér-Rao bound for near-field sources is presented in spherical harmonics domain. Various source localization experiments were conducted on simulated and signal acquired over spherical microphone array in an anechoic chamber. Root-mean-square error and probability of resolution are utilized as measures to evaluate the proposed methods. The significance and practical application of the proposed methods is discussed using experiment on interference suppression. The near-field SH-MVDR beamforming is utilized in this context.},

We present a three-dimensional sonic crystal acoustic metacage structure for hybrid purposes of noise shielding and natural ventilation. The metacage prototype comprises sixteen cylindrical sonic crystal column structures (C2 and K2 types) placed at a regular distance along the circular periphery. Each column consists of two semi-cylindrical long cavities with slit channels, which allow the sound wave to enter the Helmholtz cavities and are responsible for sound attenuation. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the acoustic metacage. Experimental measurements display the maximum sound insertion loss values of 20.8 dBA and 11.9 dBA for K2 type sonic crystal metacage, respectively, when the sound source is placed outside and inside the cage. For C2 type sonic crystal metacage, two sound insertion loss peaks with maximum values of 19.8 dBA and 10.4 dBA have been achieved at 2500~Hz when the sound source is kept outside and inside. The numerical results suggest the frequency tuning capabilities by adjusting the metacage size. Also, the modular design features enable the tunable operating frequency to meet different requirements.},

  abstract = {Digital signage in public spaces is generally silent. However, the emission of sound with the aim of generating recallability produces noise, which can be uncomfortable for passersby in the surrounding space, resulting in a loss of acoustic comfort. In this paper, we implement an On-Demand pinpoint audio system in which sound is delivered only to one person, and only the sound of the advertisement that attracts the person’s attention is played. By applying this system to passersby, this paper examines the system’s influence on advertisement recallability and acoustic comfort. Additionally, we detect the categories of advertisements affecting the advertisement recallability and acoustic comfort when digital signs emit sound. Through experiments with 30 participants, acoustic comfort is maintained and On-Demand System can reduce noise level compared to loudspeaker. In addition, we collected participants’ self-reported recallabilities and analyzed by advertising category. These results show that music-dominating advertisements presented by the On-Demand System were more recallable than silent and other advertisement categories. These results indicate the possibility of personalization of the advertising information and the perceptual spaces, even if the individuals are in public spaces.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss methods of designing parametric speakers consisting of a small number of transducers. The developed parametric speaker unit includes peripheral acoustic structures, such as radial cones and a waveguide comprising a sonic crystal. The purpose of this study is to fabricate small parametric speakers that can be installed in various equipment. To achieve this purpose, it is essential to minimize the sizes and numbers of transducers. Parametric speakers must fulfill two goals: (1) high sound pressure levels of ultrasonic waves and (2) narrow directivities of ultrasonic waves. These two design goals are accomplished by two measures: (1) two close resonant frequencies and resonant mode control function and (2) an external adapter to obtain narrow directivities and high sound pressure. The first measure was achieved equipping the piezoelectric transducer with double-linked diaphragms and two radial cones. The second measure was embodied by the waveguide consisting of a sonic crystal, which was named the loop horn in this paper. Details of the design and experimental data of a four-transducer parametric speaker unit including the loop horn were presented.},

We apply the technique to the backward and the forward scattering of a quasi-optical beam in the form of the fundamental HE11 mode by a sphere inside a circular hollow dielectric waveguide. The results calculated for the perfectly conducting spherical objects inside the circular hollow dielectric waveguide are compared with corresponding measured data of the backward-and the forward-scattering characteristics at the 4-mm wave band.}

  abstract = {Aqueous solutions of polyelectrolyte and oppositely charged ionic surfactant are proposed to have a string-of-pearls structure under strongly acidic conditions. This differs from the cylindrical structure presented by this same system at neutral pH conditions. Experimental data are consistent with the conclusion that there is a cylinder-to-sphere transition of the adsorbed surfactant when pH is dropped below a critical value. At intermediate concentrations, this transition is manifested as a pH-induced gelation. At dilute conditions, the aggregate structure is characterized through light scattering, potentiometry, (1)H NMR, and solubility measurements. Protonation of the carboxylate groups on the polyelectrolyte and resulting restructuring of the micellar structure around the aggregate are argued to be the primary causes of the transition. Since these are completely reversible, the addition of NaOH, a strong base, is observed to reverse the structure from string-of-pearls back to cylindrical. This reversible pH-induced transition, which is caused by a shift in intermolecular forces within the aggregate, is likely to be common among self-assembled aggregates. These aggregates represent a region of the polyelectrolyte-surfactant aggregate formation (that of hydrophobic polymer and varying electrostatic attraction of opposite charged moieties) that exhibits distinctive aggregate structural behavior.}

We describe an active sound control system fitted onto the opening of the domestic window that attenuates the incident sound, achieving a global reduction in the room interior while maintaining natural ventilation. The incident sound is actively attenuated by an array of control modules (a small loudspeaker) distributed optimally across the aperture. A single reference microphone provides advance information for the controller to compute the anti-noise signal input to the loudspeakers in real-time. A numerical analysis revealed that the maximum active attenuation potential outperforms the perfect acoustic insulation provided by a fully shut single-glazed window in ideal conditions. To determine the real-world performance of such an active control system, an experimental system is realized in the aperture of a full-sized window installed on a mockup room. Up to 10-dB reduction in energy-averaged sound pressure level was achieved by the active control system in the presence of a recorded real-world broadband noise. However, attenuation in the low-frequency range and its maximum power output is limited by the size of the loudspeakers.},

Based on these properties we derive ideal transformation parameters and discuss how the logarithmic Fourier transform can be applied to convolutions. The ability of the logarithmic Fourier transform to perform these operations on multiscale (nonintegrable) functions with power-law tails with exponentially small errors makes it the method of choice for many physical applications, which we demonstrate on typical examples. These include benchmarks against known analytical results inaccessible to other numerical methods, as well as physical models near criticality.},

A detailed comparison between results obtained using pressure-squared sensing and energy density sensing is presented and the distributions of the zones of quiet are discussed. Three-dimensional visualization of the sound fields confirms that significant localized sound attenuation can be achieved in specific areas even an overall amplification of total potential energy in the enclosure results. The present results also show the occurrence of the detrimental effects and spillovers under the pressure-squared sensing, while they can be removed by using the energy density control. The energy density control results in more uniform sound fields, but is not effective if the error sensor is located between the primary and secondary sound sources. The present finding on producing large quiet zones using a simple system has significant implication for building noise control.},

However, it is difficult to deploy a powerful DNN in real-time applications because of its high computational cost. Typical compression methods such as pruning and quantization do not make good use of the data characteristics. In this paper, we introduce the Skip-RNN strategy into speech enhancement models with parallel RNNs. The states of the RNNs update intermittently without interrupting the update of the output mask, which leads to significant reduction of computational load without evident audio artifacts. To better leverage the difference between the voice and the noise, we further regularize the skipping strategy with voice activity detection (VAD) guidance, saving more computational load. Experiments on a high-performance speech enhancement model, dual-path convolutional recurrent network (DPCRN), show the superiority of our strategy over strategies like network pruning or directly training a smaller model. We also validate the generalization of the proposed strategy on two other competitive speech enhancement models.},

The E-field-induced cylindrical micelles revert to spherical micelles when the E field is switched off.}

An important application of these algorithms is focused source reproduction. The focused source reproduction capability is strongly coupled with the array length. The array length is a very important design factor in consumer products, but it is very short in home entertainment systems, compared with ideal WFS systems or theater speaker systems. Therefore, a well-defined measure for the maximum focusing range is necessary for designing an array speaker product. In this paper, a maximum focusable range measure is proposed and is analyzed by simulation of a small array speaker. The analysis results show that the proposed maximum focusable range has properties strongly related to the capability for focused source reproduction.},

To reproduce such a sound field using a linear loudspeaker array, the driving function of the array is derived in the format of an integral formula. The proposed function shows fewer reproduction errors than a conventional formula focused on magnitude variations. In addition, analysis of the sweet spot reveals that its shape can be asymmetric, depending on the order of harmonics.},

For the first set of experiment, the maximum insertion loss can be found at frequency of 1100 Hz which was about 7.7 dBA. The effects of louver blade angles were reduced with the increasing distance from the sonic crystal window. The amount of noise attenuated by the sonic crystal window was increased by 0.3 dBA when the noise source was located at 2 m away from the sonic crystal window. By comparing with louver blade without jagged edge, the amount of noise attenuated by the sonic crystal window was increased by 0.3 dBA for blade angles of 0° and 30° and 0.1 dBA for blade angle of 60° when the edge of louver blade was in jagged shape.},

  abstract = {Higher-order phases are characterized by corner or hinge modes that arise due to the interesting interplay of localization mechanisms along two or more dimensions. In this work, we introduce and construct a novel class of “hybrid” higher-order skin-topological boundary modes in nonreciprocal systems with two or more open boundaries. Their existence crucially relies on nonreciprocal pumping in addition to topological localization. Unlike usual non-Hermitian “skin” modes, they can exist in lattices with vanishing net reciprocity due to the selective nature of nonreciprocal pumping: While the bulk modes remain extended due to the cancellation of nonreciprocity within each unit cell, boundary modes experience a curious spontaneous breaking of reciprocity in the presence of topological localization, thereby experiencing the non-Hermitian skin effect. The number of possible hybridization channels increases rapidly with dimensionality, leading to a proliferation of distinct phases. In addition, skin modes or hybrid skin-topological modes can restore unitarity and are hence stable, allowing for experimental observations and manipulations in non-Hermitian photonic and electrical metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Acoustic holography has been gaining attention for various applications such as non-contact particle manipulation, non-invasive neuromodulation, and medical imaging. However, only a few studies on how to generate acoustic holograms have been conducted, and even conventional acoustic hologram algorithms show limited performance in the fast and accurate generation of acoustic holograms, thus hindering the development of novel applications. We here propose a deep learning-based framework to achieve fast and accurate acoustic hologram generation. The framework has an autoencoder-like architecture; thus the unsupervised training is realized without any ground truth. For the framework, we demonstrate a newly developed hologram generator network, the Holographic Ultrasound generation Network (HU-Net), which is suitable for unsupervised learning of hologram generation, and a novel loss function that is devised for energy-efficient holograms. Furthermore, for considering various hologram devices (i.e., ultrasound transducers), we propose a physical constraint layer. Simulation and experimental studies were carried out for two different hologram devices such as a 3D printed lens, attached to a single element transducer, and a 2D ultrasound array. The proposed framework was compared with the iterative angular spectrum approach (IASA) and the state-of-the-art iterative optimization method, Diff-PAT. In the simulation study, our framework showed a few hundred times faster generation speed, along with comparable or even better reconstruction quality, than those of IASA and Diff-PAT. In the experimental study, the framework was validated with 3D-printed lenses fabricated based on different methods, and the physical effect of the lenses on the reconstruction quality was discussed. The outcomes of the proposed framework in various cases (i.e., hologram generator networks, loss functions, hologram devices) suggest that our framework may become a very useful alternative tool for other existing acoustic hologram applications and it can expand novel medical applications.},

  abstract = {A circular active noise barrier using a theoretically calculated control filter without real-time adaptation was proposed for noise reduction in a specific outdoor space. A compact circular barrier is used for the movable system to cope with changes in the location of the workspace, and noise in a wide frequency band can be reduced by conducting active noise control through control speakers arranged around a barrier. However, there was a significant performance gap compared with the maximum performance achieved by using the experimental fixed filter due to an extremely simplified theoretical model which ignores the interaction between the control speakers and the barrier. Therefore, this study tried to minimize the performance degradation when applying the theoretically calculated control filter. Another theoretical model is introduced to improve the noise reduction performance by considering the interaction between the control speaker and the barrier. Through experiment, it is confirmed that noise reduction performance is improved by about 2.6~dB in the frequency of interest.},

Factors are described that influence the speed of sound in wood, including the different types of acoustic waves which propagate in tree stems and lumber. Acoustic tools and techniques that have been used to measure the stiffness of wood are reviewed. The reasons for a systematic difference between direct and acoustic measurements of stiffness for standing trees, and methods for correction, are discussed. Other techniques, which have been used in addition to acoustics to try to improve stiffness measurements, are also briefly described. Also reviewed are studies which have used acoustic tools to investigate factors that influence the stiffness of trees. These factors include different silvicultural practices, geographic and environmental conditions, and genetics.},

  abstract = {The profitability of agricultural industries that utilise pasture can be strongly affected by the ability to accurately measure pasture biomass. Pasture height measurement is one technique that has been used to estimate pasture biomass. However, pasture height measurement errors can occur if the sensor is mounted to a farm vehicle that experiences tilting or bouncing. This work describes the development of novel low ultrasonic frequency arrays for pasture biomass estimation. Rather than just measuring the distance to the top of the pasture, as previous ultrasonic studies have done, this hardware is designed to also allow ultrasonic measurements to be made vertically through the pasture to the ground. The hardware was mounted to a farm bike driving over pasture at speeds of up to 20 km/h. The analysed results show the ability of the hardware to measure the ground location through the grass. This allowed pasture height measurement to be independent of tilting and bouncing of the farm vehicle, leading to 20 to 25\% improvement in the     R 2     value obtained for biomass estimation compared with the traditional technique. This corresponded to a reduction in root mean squared error of predicted biomass from about 350 to 270 kg/ha, where the average biomass of the pasture was 1915 kg/ha.},

A spherical version of such a transducer was mounted in an EPICS CVA flow-cell housing and was installed on a research prototype equipped with an argon-ion laser. The signal that was produced by the spherical transducer with EPICS DNA-Check beads was 1.73 times greater than that produced with the standard cylindrical flow cell. Similarly, with EPICS Immuno-Brite beads, the average ratio was 1.96. The Coulter impedance and light-scattering measurements were similar to those produced with the conventional cylindrical outside flow cell, although the internal cross section of the sphere was square and that of the cylinder was circular. The theoretical arguments of Leif and Wells have been demonstrated to be correct. At present, monolithic, spherical fused-silica transducers are the optimal design for combined electrooptical, multiparameter flow cytometry analyzers.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a design method for polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) structural acoustic sensors for the active control of sound radiation into enclosures. It combines genetic algorithms and the quadratic optimal approach to search for a sensor configuration capable of detecting vibration components with strong sound-radiation ability. In this research, one PVDF sensor is not limited to one single piece of continuous PVDF film. It can consist of a cluster of small PVDF pieces, which could be discrete. Therefore, the parameters to be optimized are the number and the locations of PVDF pieces involved in a sensor. The design method is applied to a cylindrical shell with a floor partition. The general design guidelines are discussed. To show the effectiveness of the method, the control performance of an optimal sensor arrangement is compared with that of non-optimal ones. Physical insights are obtained using structural modal response analysis, modal spectrum analysis of the PVDF sensor output, and structural acoustical coupling analysis. The performance of a PVDF sensor configuration designed at one acoustic resonant frequency is also investigated for other disturbance frequencies below 500 Hz, showing that a significant reduction of acoustic potential energy can be achieved over a wide frequency range. It is demonstrated that, with PVDF sensors optimally designed using the proposed method, the active control of sound radiation into enclosures can be achieved without using acoustic transducers.},

A brief historic overview of the study of spherical waves diffracted by a rigid half plane is presented also. The physical principles of sound diffraction by a thin plane are explained. The mathematical expressions are cast in a convenient form for ease of numerical implementation. Accurate analytical solutions are expressed in terms of standard mathematical functions that can be computed readily. Among the approximate solutions quoted, quite a few empirical formulations are adequate for most engineering purposes. The information presented in this paper should also be helpful for those who are interested in the study of sound diffracted by a barrier in a room or in a long industrial space. Ó 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Active control of sound transmission through a mechanically linked double-wall structure into an acoustic enclosure is investigated in this paper. Based on a fully coupled vibro-acoustic model, the effect of mechanical links on the selection of control strategies is studied by examining (a) cavity control using acoustic sources inside the air gap and (b) structural control using structural actuators between the two panels. The relationship between the transmission path and the control strategies is explored. Numerical results show that cavity control can provide good noise attenuation for soft links when acoustic transmitting path dominates, while either structural or cavity controls can be used with the increase of stiffness of links depending on the frequency range of interest. For each case, the dominant control mechanism is examined and the alteration in the structural–acoustic coupling is analyzed to explain the mechanisms of attenuation. The effect of the acoustic mode (0,0,0) on active control of energy transmission is also discussed, giving guidance to choosing the appropriate control arrangement to ensure the maximum control performance.},

  abstract = {We have used the cell dynamic simulations (CDS) method to study the evolution of asymmetric and symmetric diblock copolymers under electric fields. For symmetric diblock copolymers, long-range-ordered lamellar phases form readily under electric fields. For asymmetric diblock copolymers, sphere-to-cylinder phase transitions occur rapidly when strong electric fields are applied, but it takes longer for the system to form hexagonal cylinder structures. The results of these simulations suggest that the sphere phase is stable under weak electric fields, but a threshold electric intensity exists for the sphere-to-cylinder phase transition. In addition, we also studied the kinetic pathways of the transition of the lamellar phase to the hexagonal cylinder phase of the asymmetric diblock copolymers under electric fields. Hexagonal cylinder structures form when the lamellar phase is subjected to a sudden temperature jump. The scattering functions suggest that the hexagonal cylinder structures are very regular and possess very few flaws.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a general model for dealing with acoustic coupling between an enclosure and a Helmholtz resonator array, which leads to a special model when the array retreats to one resonator. The general model considers a significant number of enclosure modes, resonators, and sources, and gives more accurate prediction results without suffering from the singularity problem met before. The development of the special model results in a rigorous analytical solutions, which allows us to reexamine some of the previous studies reported in literatures. Based on the special model, a frequency equation to predict the frequency variation at both the targeted and off-target modes due to inserting a resonator into the enclosure is provided, and a method to constrain the worsened noise level at off-target modes is also discussed. Comparisons are made among computed data using the present model, previously published models, and measured results, and generally favorable agreement between prediction and measurement is observed. The present model is helpful to numerically evaluate the noise control performance of a resonator array installed in an enclosure, and also useful to semi-analytically determine the optimal location for resonators, which currently still involves heavy experimental measurements on a trial-and-error basis.},

By careful selection of the phase profiles in the transverse direction of the metasurfaces, some fascinating wavefront engineering phenomena are demonstrated, such as anomalous reflections, conversion of propagating waves into surface waves, planar aberration-free lens and nondiffracting Bessel beam generated by planar acoustic axicon.

Studying the simulation results in high degrees of freedom that created a demand for massive simulation tasks. In this paper, we report a parallel implementation of the simulation program based on the compute unified device architecture running on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Different schemes for sphere-only simulations and sphere-cylinder mixture simulations were developed. Diverse optimizing methods were employed to achieve the best acceleration. The final-version GPU program is hundreds of times faster than the CPU version. Dependence of the performance on input parameters and precision were also studied. It is shown that using single precision in the GPU simulations results in very limited losses in accuracy. Consumer-level graphics cards, even those in laptop computers, are more cost-effective than scientific graphics cards for single-precision computation.}

In this work, we propose and experimentally verify the use of an acoustic cell architecture that provides enough degrees of freedom to fully control the bianisotropic response and minimizes the losses. The versatility of the approach is shown through the design of three refractive metasurfaces capable of redirecting a normally incident plane wave to 60°, 70°, and 80° on transmission. The efficiency of the bianisotropic designs is over 90\%, much higher than the corresponding generalized Snell’s law based designs (81\%, 58\%, and 35\%). The proposed strategy opens a new way of designing practical and highly efficient bianisotropic metasurfaces for different functionalities, enabling nearly ideal control over the energy flow through thin metasurfaces.},

The present work is extended to directly use the multipole expansion to calculate the scattering from an elastic spherical target. The incident Bessel beam is located at an arbitrary location with respect to the center of the sphere. The far-field resonance scattering in both on- and off-axis incidences are calculated by subtracting an appropriate background from the total scattering based on the resonance scattering theory. The results reveal that the ordinary or helicoidal Bessel beams with selected half-cone angle could lead to resonance suppression at some resonance frequencies for on-axis incidence, however not for off-axis incidence. The intrinsic property of the elastic scattering contribution from a sphere is shown by the three-dimensional patterns of resonance scattering. The resonance scattering and suppression from thin and thick shells are also noted.}

The dfUS signal arises primarily from the second-order non-linear coefficient, a contrast mechanism that differs from linear and harmonic US imaging. The distinct contrast mechanism allows dfUS to image anatomic features that are not identifiable in conventional US images of salmon and pig kidney tissue. Further, dfUS produces enhanced contrast of glioblastoma tumor implanted in the mouse brain, revealing its potential for improving medical diagnosis.

Accordingly, this tutorial is structured into two parts, one on resonance-based acoustic metamaterials, in the frequency domain, and one on topological acoustics, based on the wavevector domain as topological structures inherently involve spatial configurations that are a step beyond the simple periodic lattices. Each part will begin with a brief introduction of the basic principles, followed by two examples described in detail. In the first part, we present decorated membrane resonators and the broadband optimal acoustic absorption structures, the latter being crucial for the potential applications of acoustic metamaterials. In the second part, we discuss how to construct the Dirac cone, a special type of dispersion from either accidental degeneracy or symmetry protection, which can be shown to lead to negative, zero, or positive refractive indices. The shifting and gapping of these Dirac cones in the reciprocal space can result in effects on acoustic waves similar to that of a magnetic field on an electron. More generally, they lead to edge states resulting from a real-space gauge field as well as topological bandgaps.},

  abstract = {Particles can be manipulated along boundary-free channels in a noncontact way by designing acoustic structures in the shadow.           ,              Acoustic tweezers use ultrasound for contact-free, bio-compatible, and precise manipulation of particles from millimeter to submicrometer scale. In microfluidics, acoustic tweezers typically use an array of sources to create standing wave patterns that can trap and move objects in ways constrained by the limited complexity of the acoustic wave field. Here, we demonstrate spatially complex particle trapping and manipulation inside a boundary-free chamber using a single pair of sources and an engineered structure outside the chamber that we call a shadow waveguide. The shadow waveguide creates a tightly confined, spatially complex acoustic field inside the chamber without requiring any interior structure that would interfere with net flow or transport. Altering the input signals to the two sources creates trapped particle motion along an arbitrary path defined by the shadow waveguide. Particle trapping, particle manipulation and transport, and Thouless pumping are experimentally demonstrated.},

As a promising artificial two-dimensional metamaterial, a metasurface can be used as the generator of self-accelerating beams. However, restricted by the generalized Snell's law, most research hotspots focus on flat metasurfaces. In this Letter, the generalized Snell's law on an arbitrary curved reflective surface is discussed. Then, the phase profile for the self-accelerating beams generated from the curved reflective surface is derived based on the caustic theory. The metasurface consisting of the tunable spiral path units is constructed, and numerical and experimental validations are performed.

Particle trapping is usually associated with either radiation forces or acoustic streaming fields. Acoustic tweezers based on single-beam focused acoustic vortices have attracted considerable attention due to their selective trapping capability, but have proven difficult to use for three-dimensional (3D) trapping without a complex transducer array and significant constraints on the trapped particle properties. Here we demonstrate a 3D acoustic tweezer in fluids that uses a single transducer and combines the radiation force for trapping in two dimensions with the streaming force to provide levitation in the third dimension. The idea is demonstrated in both simulation and experiments operating at 500\,kHz, and the achieved levitation force reaches three orders of magnitude larger than for previous 3D trapping. This hybrid acoustic tweezer that integrates acoustic streaming adds an additional twist to the approach and expands the range of particles that can be manipulated.},

We observe unambiguously the peculiar Möbius edge and hinge states via real-space visualization of their localiztions, momentum-space spectroscopy of their 4π periodicity, and phase-space winding of their projective translation eigenvalues. Not only does our work open a new avenue for artificial systems under the interplay between gauge and crystalline symmetries, but it also initializes a new framework for topological physics from projective symmetry.},

  abstract = {The manipulation of acoustic waves plays an important role in a wide range of applications. Currently, acoustic wave manipulation typically relies on either acoustic metasurfaces or phased array transducers. The elements of traditional metasurfaces are usually designed with complex artificial structures and limited by the additive manufacturing capability, which are difficult to apply in MHz frequency underwater acoustic wave control. Phased array transducers, suffering from high-cost and complex control circuits, are usually limited by the array size and the filling ratio of the control units. Coding piezoelectric metasurfaces are reported; three wave functionalities, including beam steering, beam focusing, and vortex beam focusing are demonstrated; and acoustic tweezers and ultrasound imaging are eventually realized. The information coded on the piezoelectric metasurfaces herein is frequency independent and originates from the polarization directions, pointing either up or down, of the piezoelectric materials. Such a piezoelectric metasurface is driven by a single electrode and acts as a controllable active sound source, which combines the advantages of acoustic metasurfaces and phased array transducers while keeping the devices structurally simple and compact. The coding piezoelectric metasurfaces lead to potential technological innovations in underwater acoustic wave modulation, acoustic tweezers, biomedical imaging, industrial nondestructive testing, and neural regulation.},

The remarkable physics and behavior of waves at these EPs have raised considerable attention. Previous research has accessed EPs in parity-time (PT) symmetric systems through spatially modulated parameters. Using acoustics, this Letter demonstrates a different family of EPs in classical wave systems that emerge from coordinated modulation of mass density and loss/gain in time. This condition can create nonreciprocal coupling between arbitrary modes at the EPs, leading to exotic behaviors such as unilateral frequency conversion and linear amplification of waves that are unattainable at conventional time-invariant systems. Moreover, these phenomena can be attained with only loss, and acoustic gain via modal energy transfer is demonstrated in a loss-only system at such EPs. Our work marries time-varying systems with EPs, which could open new avenues for wave manipulation.},

At the same time, the Doyle-Chebyshev beam control method is used to suppress the sidelobes and concentrate the generated infrasonic waves in the direction of the main axis. Finally, the important parameter, namely the infrasonic wave array length, is analyzed to find out at which length the infrasound source level reaches the approximate peak. Through comparison, it is found that the actual array length is smaller than the effective array length.},

It is shown that the nonreciprocal coupling leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect in a substantial way. Besides, it widens the parameter space of the zero-energy modes in the band gap, and modifies the transition manner from the topologically trivial to topologically nontrivial phase. When the nonreciprocal coupling exceeds its critical value, the zero-energy modes will split, giving rise to the appearance of new nonzero- or complex-energy modes. What is more, differently from the chain configuration, the nonreciprocal coupling makes purely imaginary energy modes emerge in the band gap of the SSH-ring configuration. Next in the presence of hopping disorder, we observe that the zero-energy modes are relatively robust, whereas the imaginary part of energies displays the nonmonotonic changes. It can be thus believed that all these findings promote understanding the influences of nonreciprocal couplings on the types and properties of isolated modes in the SSH lattices.},

  abstract = {Multichannel active noise control (ANC) systems have been widely investigated for low-frequency noise attenuation over a spatial region. Using a conventional centralized control strategy based on the multichannel filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm has been demonstrated to be effective for multichannel ANC systems, but the high computational burden restricts its practical applications. Meanwhile, a decentralized control strategy suffers from stability problems although it has been successful in reducing the computational load. Recently, distributed control strategies, such as the multitask diffusion adaptation scheme, have been introduced to ANC systems and shown to mitigate the stability problems in decentralized systems. However, distributed ANC systems using the diffusion FxLMS algorithm require strong symmetry of acoustic paths because of the dependence on node-based adaptation and neighborhood-based combination. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an Augmented Diffusion FxLMS algorithm with neighborhood-based adaptation and node-based combination. A theoretical formulation and convergence analysis are presented and simulations are performed to compare the proposed algorithm with existing ones under different system configurations for tonal, multi-tonal, narrowband and broadband signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the same noise reduction performance as centralized method even if the acoustic paths are strongly asymmetrical, which is superior over existing distributed multitask diffusion strategy.},

It is the core noise attenuation mechanism in this silencer. The transfer matrix method is used to investigate the silencer performance. A periodic silencer array is also developed to broaden the bandwidth and increase the magnitude of noise attenuation. The results predicted by the plane wave theory fit well with the simulation using a three-dimensional finite element method. A simplified experiment was conducted to verify the silencing effect of the silencer and the accuracy of theoretical prediction method. Contrasting with a traditional reactive silencer, low-frequency noise attenuation can be achieved in a more compact and flexible way, which can be seen as an improvement in low frequency noise control.},

The transmitted sound field can be manipulated arbitrarily to form a desired shape by designing the ultrathin pattern based on the nonlocal wave interaction theory. The physical mechanism of the nonlocal behavior to achieve a sophisticated hologram is revealed due to the interaction among the sound wave components themselves. Furthermore, the experiments are designed to map out the pressure amplitude field of a “sun” pattern in air and water, respectively.

  abstract = {The multichannel variational autoencoder (MVAE) integrates the rule-based update of a separation matrix and the deep generative model and proves to be a competitive speech separation method. However, the output (global) permutation ambiguity still exists and turns out to be a fundamental problem in applications. In this paper, we address this problem by employing two dedicated encoders. One encodes the speaker identity for the guidance of the output sorting, and the other encodes the linguistic information for the reconstruction of the source signals. The instance normalization (IN) and the adaptive instance normalization (adaIN) are applied to the networks to disentangle the speaker representations from the content representations. The separated sources are arranged in designated order by a symmetric permutation alignment scheme. In the experiments, we test the proposed method in different gender combinations and various reverberant conditions and generalize it to unseen speakers. The results validate its reliable sorting accuracy and good separation performance. The proposed method outperforms the other baseline methods and maintains stable performance, achieving over 20 dB SIR improvement even in high reverberant environments.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental theorem in information theory is the so-called sampling theorem also known as Shannon-Nyquist theorem. This theorem aims at giving the minimal frequency needed to sample and reconstruct perfectly an analog band-limited signal. Compressive sensing (or compressed sensing, compressive sampling) or CS in short is a recent theory that allows, if the signal to be reconstructed satisfies a number of conditions, to decrease the amount of data needed to reconstruct the signal. As a result this theory can be used for at least two purposes: i) accelerate the acquisition rate without decreasing the reconstructed signal quality (e.g. in terms of resolution, SNR, contrast ...) ii) improve the image quality without increasing the quantity of needed data. Even if medical ultrasound is a domain where several potential applications can be highlighted, the use of this theory in this domain is extremely recent. In this paper we review the basic theory of compressive sensing. Then, a review of the existing CS studies in the field of medical ultrasound is given: reconstruction of sparse scattering maps, pre-beamforming channel data, post-beamforming signals and slow time Doppler data. Finally the open problems and challenges to be tackled in order to make the application of CS to medical US a reality will be given.},

The analytical model is established to explore the nonlinear phenomenon, specifically the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of the nonlinear unit cell, and validated through numerical and experimental studies. By tailoring the phase gradient of the unit cells, nonlinear acoustic metasurfaces are developed to demultiplex different frequency components and achieve anomalous wavefront control of SHG in the transmitted region. To this end, we numerically demonstrate wave steering, wave focusing, and self-bending propagation. Our results show that the proposed nonlinear metasurface provides an effective and efficient platform to achieve significant SHG and separate different harmonic components for wavefront control of individual harmonics. Overall, this study offers an outlook to harness nonlinear effects for acoustic wavefront tailoring and develops potential toward advanced technologies to manipulate acoustic waves.},

During these so-called fluctuation scattering experiments, the absence of rotational averaging, typically induced by Brownian motion in classic solution-scattering experiments, increases the information content of the data. In order to perform shape reconstruction or structure refinement from such data, it is essential to compute the theoretical profiles from three-dimensional models. Based on the three-dimensional Zernike polynomial expansion models, a fast method to compute the theoretical fluctuation scattering profiles has been derived. The theoretical profiles have been validated against simulated results obtained from 300\hspace{0.25em}000 scattering patterns for several representative biomolecular species.},

Critical micelle concentrations were measured using electrical conductivity and were found to depend on both the counterion and its hydrolysis state. All monovalent counterions bind less strongly to the micelle surface than does bromide or chloride, whereas multivalent species bind more strongly. Small-angle neutron scattering reveals that, unlike alkyltrimethylammonium bromides and chlorides, micelles are small and spherical in the presence of hydrolyzable counterions of all valences and remain spherical even in the presence of added electrolyte. This is consistent with the strong solvation of even strongly bound hydrolyzable counterions, which prevents the screening of repulsions between adjacent headgroups necessary for sphere-cylinder transformations. Salts of multivalent hydrolyzable counterions could thus be used to control the micelle structure in novel ways.}

Here we report that new sires of laboratory mice, though not spontaneously parental, can be induced to show maternal-like parental care (pup retrieval) using signals from dams separated from their pups. During this interaction, the maternal mates emit 38-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations to their male partners, which are equivalent to vocalizations that occur following pheromone stimulation. Without these signals or in the absence of maternal mates, the sires do not retrieve their pups within 5 min. These results show that, in mice, the maternal parent communicates to the paternal parent to encourage pup care. This new paradigm may be useful in the analysis of the parental brain during paternal care induced by interactive communication.},

In the present work, such a proof of the completeness of the Cartesian multipole series, both in two and three dimensions, is given, and the linear dependence relations among different orders of multipoles are discussed, which then allows one to easily extract a basis from the multipole series. In particular, it is concluded that the multipoles comprising the two highest orders in the series form a basis of the whole series, since the multipoles of all the lower source orders can be expressed as a linear combination of that basis.},

  abstract = {Fourier-based Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH), Statistically Optimized Nearfield Acoustical Holography (SONAH) and the Equivalent Source Method (ESM) are widely used in noise source identification and as important tools to guide design modification for noise control purposes. Fourier transform-based NAH requires the sound field to fall to negligible levels outside the measurement aperture, which is a requirement that is rarely met in practice. To overcome this difficulty, SONAH and ESM have been developed. In addition, the Inverse Boundary Element Method (IBEM) can also be used, given sufficient computational resources. Unfortunately, none of these methods can directly guide the design modifications required to unequivocally reduce noise radiation from sources. Previously, radiation mode analysis has been primarily associated with the forward prediction of sound power radiated from noise sources. Since radiation modes contribute independently to the sound power radiation, it is only necessary to modify the surface vibration so that it is not strongly coupled with those modes having high radiation efficiencies in order to ensure sound power reduction. In the current work, an inverse method based on radiation modes was investigated, in which the radiation modes were used as the basis functions to describe surface motion of a source. Thus, this procedure allows the surface vibration that results in the majority of the radiated sound power to be identified unequivocally, and so will, in turn, guide the design changes needed to reduce radiated sound power.},

The present work started with a model in the latter category, but the individual sources were then allowed to move separately to locations which were determined by using a nonlinear optimization procedure based on the measured sound field data. To test this approach, experiments were conducted using a small loudspeaker cabinet; measurements were made using an array of microphones on all sides of the loudspeaker. It was found that by allowing the source components to move, the sound field representation in both the near and far fields was improved, particularly at high frequencies, compared to the model with fixed source locations. By comparison with results obtained from boundary element calculations based on laser vibrometer measurements of the loudspeaker's diaphragm and tweeter velocities, it was found that the proposed ESM can also be used to accurately predict the sound pressure distribution on the source surface.},

At the transition point from the unbroken to broken parity-time symmetry phase, the unidirectional sound focusing effect (along with reflectionless acoustic transparency in the opposite direction) is experimentally realized over the spectrum. This demonstration confirms the capability of passive acoustic systems to carry the experimental studies on general parity-time symmetry physics and further reveals the unique functionalities enabled by the judiciously tailored unidirectional wave vectors in space.},

It requires coupling between stress and velocity or momentum and strain fields, which is difficult to induce in non-negligible levels, even when using metamaterial structures. Here, we report the experimental realization of a Willis metamaterial for flexural waves. Based on a cantilever bending resonance, we demonstrate asymmetric reflection amplitudes and phases due to Willis coupling. We also show that, by introducing loss in the metamaterial, the asymmetric amplitudes can be controlled and can be used to approach an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian system, at which unidirectional zero reflection occurs. The present work extends conventional propagation theory in plates and beams to include Willis coupling and provides new avenues to tailor flexural waves using artificial structures.},

Through the finite element simulation of the acoustic scattering of the target in the free field, the sound scattering field is equated to the radiation field of a directional point source. Subsequently, the point source is placed in the channel, and the acoustic ray method is used to calculate the distribution of the scattering field. On the basis of theoretical modelling, the method of obtaining the directional point source and the influence of the sea surface on the impedance of the scattering field are analysed. Subsequently, the proposed method is compared with the finite element method in terms of computational efficiency. The result shows that the method considers the multiple complex coupling effects between the elastic structure and marine environment. The influence of the boundary is approximately negligible when the distance from the ocean boundary to the elastic structure is equal to the wavelength. The method only performs finite element coupling calculation in the free field; the amount of mesh size is greatly reduced and the calculation efficiency is significantly improved when compared with the finite element calculation in the entire channel, the. The calculation time in the example can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude. This method organically combines the near-field calculation with acoustic ray theory and it can realise the rapid calculation of the large-scale acoustic scattering field in complex marine environments.},

  abstract = {Longer-range interactions, or couplings beyond the second nearest neighbors, have long been overlooked in topological models for either topological insulators or semimetals. For natural (electronic) materials, such ignorance is reasonable as near-range couplings are always dominant. However, artificially constructed metamaterials can break such a limitation, allowing the longer-range couplings comparable with the nearer ones, achieving alternative properties unattainable in natural materials. Here, we report a one-dimensional acoustic metamaterial designed in terms of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, containing the nearest, and in particular the third-nearest couplings. In contrast to the conventional SSH model with the topological phases of the winding number one, the extended SSH model can host topological phases of winding number two, besides one, exhibiting amazing rotonlike dispersions. The larger winding number implies more end states emerging. All these predictions are confirmed by the experiments with the fabricated acoustic metamaterials. Such longer-range couplings can also be extended to two- or three-dimensional lattices, to further achieve the topological states exceptionally in metamaterials.},

Recently, nontrivial band topology is exploited to enrich the BIC physics, resulting in topological BICs (TBICs) with extraordinary robustness against perturbations or disorders. Here, we propose a simple but universal mirror-stacking approach to turn nontrivial bound states of any topological monolayer model into TBICs. Physically, the mirror-stacked bilayer Hamiltonian can be decoupled into two independent subspaces of opposite mirror parities, each of which directly inherits the energy spectrum information and band topology of the original monolayer. By tuning the interlayer couplings, the topological bound state of one subspace can move into and out of the continuum of the other subspace continuously without hybridization. As representative examples, we construct one-dimensional first-order and two-dimensional higher-order TBICs, and demonstrate them unambiguously by acoustic experiments. Our findings will expand the research implications of both topological materials and BICs.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need to develop efficient acoustics simulations for sources in different room environments, a modeling procedure has been proposed that consists of two steps in general: (1) the modeling of the free-space radiation of the source based on measurements in a anechoic environment, and (2) the prediction of the sound field in a room environment based on that free-space information. To achieve a high modeling efficiency, i.e., to reduce the number of modeling parameters while still maintaining acceptable accuracy, a Multipole Equivalent Source Model (ESM) with undetermined source locations has been developed for the free-space sound field prediction. In contrast with traditional ESM’s, or acoustical holography methods in general, the model developed in the present work possesses two efficiency improvements: (1) the use of the series of monopoles, dipoles, quadrupoles, etc. as equivalents sources (since in predicting the sound field, the multipole series can be simply represented as closely located monopoles) and (2) the flexibility of using spatially separated sources with undetermined locations. In the inverse parameter estimation process of this method, the calculation of the source strengths is linear while the source locations are determined by a nonlinear optimization procedure. It is shown, by an experimental validation, that the prediction using this method can be accurate for almost the whole audio frequency range. To model the sound field at high frequencies specifically, different types of methods using local-basis functions were developed. At high frequencies, the spatial variation of the sound field is usually large and thus the number of measurements points in space is likely not to be enough to model a relatively complicated source if a traditional equivalent source model is used, and the under-sampling errors from all regions will accumulate to affect the predictions in any particular region. However, if localized basis functions are used to represent the sound field, the under-sampling errors from different regions do not affect each other. Two types of local-basis method are developed in this work: one based on piece-wise polynomial interpolation (which is limited to having only a single source) and the other based on least squares (which can be applied to multiple sources and even to interior problems). Simulation results have shown that these local-basis methods, at very high frequencies, can achieve good overall prediction accuracy with only a loss of some details in the spatial variation of the sound field. In the room acoustics modeling section, the Equivalent Source Method is modified and implemented which, compared with the geometric acoustics models, gives a prediction based on a more rigorous mathematical foundation and, compared with Boundary Element methods, reduces the computational intensity. In this proposed room acoustics ESM, the free-space source radiation is assumed known, and the room component sound field is determined by an ESM. Differing from the free-space ESMs, this room acoustics ESM (1) contains additional equivalent sources representing the incoming waves, and (2) uses impedance boundary conditions on the surfaces instead of the measured sound field, to estimate the source strengths. It is validated by simulations (in both 2D and 3D spaces) and then by experiments that the proposed room acoustics ESM can be used as a reduced order modeling technique in simulating the sound field in a room. It is also shown that the prediction accuracy and the computational load can be flexibly balanced, if Multipole ESMs are used, by selecting an appropriate maximum source order.},

  abstract = {Efficiently receiving underwater sound remotely from air is a long-standing challenge in acoustics hindered by the large impedance mismatch at the water-air interface. Here, a phase-engineered water-air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water-to-air eavesdropping. The judiciously-designed metasurface with near-unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water-air interface acoustically transparent and at the same time freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal-to-noise ratio as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 104 at 8 kHz, far from achievable with the current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross-media orbital-angular-momentum-multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. Our metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally-reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano-optics and radio-frequencies.

However, it has been shown that they are susceptible to inaudible attacks in which the malicious signals are in the ultrasound regime and cannot be heard by human ears. In this study, we show that a judiciously designed acoustic metamaterial filter can mitigate such attacks by modulating the received signals by the microphones. The metamaterial filter is composed of rigid plates with individual holes which exhibit local resonance phenomena that suppress incoming waves at specific frequencies. The effectiveness of the metamaterial filter is confirmed by experiments which show that a combination of the holes can collectively distort the attack signals and protect the smart speakers. Moreover, normal audible signals are not affected by the proposed metamaterial, which adds to the flexibility of the device. The metamaterial filter has a small footprint and can be easily installed on various audio products. Our proposed strategy expands the capacity of acoustic metamaterials and improves the security of devices that use voice assistants.},

  abstract = {Block copolymers constitute a class of self-assembling macromolecules that offer remarkable flexibility for controlling nanostructure, both in discrete objects and in bulk materials. Block copolymer micelles may be formed with multiple compartments by judicious choice of ingredients in an ABC triblock copolymer. For example, we have shown that a poly(ethylene oxide-b-styrene-b-fluorinated butadiene) triblock assembles in dilute aqueous solution into large, flat core/shell/corona disks, with the fluorine containing block forming the core. In contrast, the unfluorinated precursor generates large spherical micelles. A numerical analysis suggests that the disk-like motif is characteristic of the so-called superstrong segregation regime, whereby the interfacial tension becomes so large as to overwhelm the conformational entropy of the core blocks. For ABC miktoarm stars comprising polyethylene oxide, polyethylethylene, and polyhexafluoropropylene oxide arms, a much richer variety of micellar structures are observed. Prominent amongst these is a "segmented worm", in which alternating layers (5-7 nm thick) of hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon blocks form disks (6-10 nm in radius) that stack into cylindrical aggregates. The disk radii suggest almost fully stretched blocks, again consistent with the superstrong segregation regime. These structures are rationalized in terms of the constraints imposed by the star architecture, combined with the extremely strong interfacial tensions. In contrast, for lipids, surfactants, and aqueous diblock copolymers, increasing the interfacial tension can induce a transition from spheres to cylinders to flat bilayers; the disk-like motif is not usually seen. Interestingly, in aqueous diblocks both worm-like micelles and vesicles have been well-documented, whereas in "simple" organic systems they have not. We have shown that by suitable choice of block composition and solvent selectivity, the curvature sequence sphere/cylinder/vesicle can also be observed in poly(styrene-b-isoprene) diblocks in dialkyl phthalates. In more concentrated solutions such spherical micelles assemble onto body-centered or face-centered cubic lattices. In some cases a thermoreversible fcc/bcc transition has been noted. We have recently demonstrated that this transition corresponds to a particular aggregation number; higher aggregation numbers, found at lower temperatures, favor the "hard-sphere-like" fcc packing. All of these results are based on a combination of dynamic light scattering, small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.}

  abstract = {For three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging, to obtain a 3D image with sufficient resolution, the inter-channel spacing (i.e., pitch) should be sufficiently small to avoid grating lobes and the aperture size needs to be large enough to ensure that the beam width is sufficiently small. Therefore, a matrix probe often consists of several thousands of channels resulting in requiring high system complexity. The sparse array (SA) method has been proposed to reduce the system complexity by selecting a set of active channels instead of fully-sampled channels; however, SA approach encounters focusing errors during beamforming which results in broadening the main lobe, as well as increasing the side-lobe and grating-lobe levels, which together degrade the image quality. In this study, a deep variational network has been presented to reconstruct the inactive channels for the sparse array system. The main advantage of the deep variational network is that this method can be trained with a comparably low number of training cases. This can be beneficial for medical 3-D/4-D ultrasound imaging reconstruction because large amount of raw 3D ultrasound RF channel data are not easy to acquire. In this study, 512 under-sampled channels were set as active by sampling 1024 channels uniformly. The fully sampled channel data (output) were captured as the ground truth using a 2-D matrix array. With the proposed method, the output image can improve the grating-lobe levels by 12.27 dB and 4.76 dB, respectively, for both the elevation and lateral projections.},

SAXS data of dry reverse micelles are consistent with a model of spherical hydrophilic core surrounded by DMEB alkyl chains whose polydispersity decreases significantly with surfactant concentration. By adding water, a sphere to cylinder transition occurs leading to a one-dimensional growth of reverse micellar cores with Rw and surfactant concentration. The observed behavior was taken as an indication that water molecules are confined in the core of DMEB reverse micelles, quite uniformly distributed among them and mainly located among surfactant head groups. EXAFS data allow to focus within the hydrophilic micellar core to solve the short range local environment around the Br(-) counterion and to follow its changing with surfactant concentration and Rw. Analysis of Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectra indicates the existence of a local order nearby the bromide ions; pointing toward a quite structured hydrophilic core of DMEB reverse micelles. However, as a consequence of the fluid nature of reverse micelles, such local order is lower than that found in the lamellar structure of solid DMEB. Water confinement within the reverse micellar cores induces an increase of the local disorder suggesting an enhancement of the micellar core dynamics.}

The 256-element spherical-section ultrasound phased array made from piezocomposite material operates at 1.1MHz with 11-cm radius of curvature, 14-cm outer diameter, and 3.4-cm diameter central hole for mounting diagnostic ultrasound imaging probe. First, the explicit sound field calculation approach for the spherical-section phased array and the genetic optimal algorithm are briefly introduced as the optimal focus pattern control methods. Then, the design guidelines of 256-element spherical-section focused ultrasound phased array and 256-channel driver system are given. The results of single on and off axial focus, multiple on and off axial foci, half sub-array focus pattern provide further evidence for the 3D focus steering and sub-array mode for avoiding obstacles in focused ultrasound surgery. The multi-foci pattern can enlarge the treatment volume to 22 times larger than that of a single focus in one sonication. Finally, in vitro and transparent tissue-mimicking phantom experiment results confirm the ability of 256-element spherical-section phased array system to induce thermal lesions for noninvasive ultrasound surgery.},

To overcome this limitation, nonlinear ANC (NLANC) algorithms were developed. In Part II, we review the development of NLANC algorithms during the last decade. The contributions of heuristic ANC algorithms are outlined. Moreover, we emphasize recent advances of NLANC algorithms, such as spline ANC algorithms, kernel adaptive filters, and nonlinear distributed ANC algorithms. Then, we present recent applications of ANC technique including linear and nonlinear perspectives. Future research challenges regarding ANC techniques are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a method for spatial upsampling of signals captured with spherical microphone arrays with a limited number of microphones. The upsampling is performed by adding virtual microphone signals using interpolation between the measured array signals. For interpolation, the differences in amplitude and time of neighbored signals are weighted separately. For this, the time differences are determined with a broadband cross-correlation. After the upsampling, the array signals can be represented as spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients at significantly higher orders. This work introduces the proposed upsampling procedure and presents a technical evaluation based on simulated and measured sound fields. Thereby, we focus on the binaural decoding of the upsampled SH signals. For perceptual evaluation, we present the results of a listening experiment evaluating the binaural reproduction of the upsampled signals compared to a baseline Ambisonics decoding and the state-of-the-art decoding with Magnitude Least-Squares optimization. Both the technical and perceptual evaluations consider only array impulse responses, but the algorithm could generally be applied to array streams. The evaluation shows that the proposed method significantly improves the binaural reproduction of low-order spherical microphone array captures compared to established methods.},

The dual-energy-window method of correction for Compton scattering is employed and the multiplier which yields correct activity for the VI as a whole calculated. The model is usually a sphere containing radioactive water located within a cylinder filled with a more dilute solution of radioactivity. Two simulation codes are employed. Reconstruction is by ML-EM algorithm with attenuation compensation. The scatter multiplier depends only slightly on the sphere location or the cylinder diameter. It also depends little on whether correction is before or after reconstruction. At low background level, it changes with VOI size, but not at higher background. For a geometrical VOI, it is 1.25 at zero background, decreases sharply to 0.56 for equal concentrations, and is 0.44 when the background concentration is very large. Quantification is accurate (less than 9\% error) if the test background is reasonably close to that used in setting the universal scatter-multiplier value, or if the test backgrounds are always large and so is the universal-value background, but not if the test backgrounds cover a large range of values including zero. Results largely agree with those from experiment after the experimental data with background is re-evaluated with prejudice.},

In this paper, a recently proposed swarm intelligence algorithm, salp swarm algorithm (SSA), is introduced for design of both linear and planar sparse antenna arrays with optimum sidelobe level (SLL). The design of sparse antenna arrays can be regarded as a nonlinear optimization problem, which the main optimization goal is finding optimum excitations and positions for antenna elements to achieve antenna array beam pattern with desired SLL. The SSA is a new kind of swarm intelligence algorithm which inspired by the swarming behavior of salps. Compared to other evolutionary algorithms, the SSA requires few algorithm-specified tuning parameters, which makes it simple and easy to use for engineering. Illustrative examples of both linear and planar arrays are given to verify the validity of the SSA for SLL reduction of sparse arrays.},

  abstract = {The selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method selecting the best pre-trained control filters for various types of noise can achieve a fast response time. However, it may lead to large steady-state errors due to inaccurate filter selection and the lack of adaptability. In comparison, the filtered-X normalized least-mean-square (FxNLMS) algorithm can obtain lower steady-state errors through adaptive optimization. Nonetheless, its slow convergence has a detrimental effect on dynamic noise attenuation. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid SFANC-FxNLMS approach to overcome the adaptive algorithm’s slow convergence and provide a better noise reduction level than the SFANC method. A lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is designed to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained control filter for each frame of the primary noise. Meanwhile, the FxNLMS algorithm continues to update the coefficients of the chosen pre-trained control filter at the sampling rate.

  abstract = {Our environment is filled with rich and dynamic acoustic information. When we walk into a cathedral, the reverberations as much as appearance inform us of the sanctuary's wide open space. Similarly, as an object moves around us, we expect the sound emitted to also exhibit this movement. While recent advances in learned implicit functions have led to increasingly higher quality representations of the visual world, there have not been commensurate advances in learning spatial auditory representations. To address this gap, we introduce Neural Acoustic Fields (NAFs), an implicit representation that captures how sounds propagate in a physical scene. By modeling acoustic propagation in a scene as a linear time-invariant system, NAFs learn to continuously map all emitter and listener location pairs to a neural impulse response function that can then be applied to arbitrary sounds. We demonstrate that the continuous nature of NAFs enables us to render spatial acoustics for a listener at an arbitrary location, and can predict sound propagation at novel locations. We further show that the representation learned by NAFs can help improve visual learning with sparse views. Finally, we show that a representation informative of scene structure emerges during the learning of NAFs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new transformation termed as the distance sinh transformation for the numerical evaluation of nearly singular integrals arising in 3D BEM. The new transformation is an improvement of the previous sinh transformation. The original sinh transformation is only limited to planar elements. Moreover, when the nearly singular point is located outside the element, results obtained by the original sinh transformation combined with conventional subdivision method are not quite accurate. In the presented work, the sinh transformation combined with the distance function is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the original sinh transformation. With the improved transformation, nearly singular integrals on the curved surface elements can be accurately calculated. Furthermore, an alternative subdivision method is proposed using an approximate nearly singular point, which is quite simple for programming and accurate results can be obtained. Numerical examples for both curved triangular and quadrangular elements are given to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the presented method.},

  abstract = {The localization of sound sources with delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming is limited by a poor spatial resolution—particularly at low frequencies. Various methods based on deconvolution are examined to improve the resolution of the beamforming map, which can be modeled by a convolution of the unknown acoustic source distribution and the beamformer's response to a point source, i.e., point-spread function. A significant limitation of deconvolution is, however, an additional computational effort compared to beamforming. In this paper, computationally efficient deconvolution algorithms are examined with computer simulations and experimental data. Specifically, the deconvolution problem is solved with a fast gradient projection method called Fast Iterative Shrikage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), and compared with a Fourier-based non-negative least squares algorithm. The results indicate that FISTA tends to provide an improved spatial resolution and is up to 30\% faster and more robust to noise. In the spirit of reproducible research, the source code is available online.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive investigation on the passive and active low frequency sound absorption performance of the finite and large sized micro -perforated panel absorber (FLS-MPPA) for oblique incidence excitation (OIE), which is of great significance for the engineering implementation of this technic. The theoretical model of the FLS-MPPA is firstly established by applying the modal analysis approach. It is also validated by experimental test. Then, the passive sound absorption performance is explored and the underlying physical mechanisms of these peculiar findings are investigated thoroughly. Finally, the active control performance (applying point source to actively control the sound field) and physical mechanism of the sound absorption improvement of the FLS-MPPA are analyzed. Results obtained demonstrate some key findings. The high order cavity modes excited by OIE reflect most of the incident sound power and have little contribution to the sound absorption in the low frequency range owing to their strong mutual coupling effects and being greatly excited with high modal amplitudes. They also cannot produce additional sound absorption peaks due to their wide resonant frequency band. Weakening such mutual coupling effects can improve the sound absorption and produce additional absorption peaks. The low frequency sound absorption of the FLS-MPPA is significantly improved with control and the achievable maximum sound absorption coefficient is slightly greater than the difference between 1 and the sound power reflection coefficient of the MPP, which validates the feasibility of the active control method for OIE. The reflected sound power induced by the cavity modes is highly reduced and part of the reflected sound power produced by the MPP can even be absorbed by these modes when their amplitudes are reduced to the optimal value, which is the physical nature of the active control. Sensing and controlling the cavity sound field in the corner achieves almost equal sound absorption improvement as that of the optimal control state, based on which the error sensing strategy is constructed.},

  abstract = {The classical normal-mode solution of the steady-state sound field in a room is revised by the addition of a direct wave term to the summation of normal functions, which represents only the reverberant sound field. It is shown that the latter as a whole may be reduced by using an active noise control system with both the pick-up microphone and the cancelling loudspeaker in the corner region of the room, well within a quarter wavelength to the three adjoining surfaces. The corner ANC system appears as the best solution of low-frequency noise reduction in the room, notwithstanding that the reduction is limited by the direct wave radiation of the secondary source. A general formula of possible noise reduction of such a system is proposed and the means of its realization discussed. Low frequency reduction of 8 dB has been realized for a band noise, centring at 100 Hz. The performance of the corner ANC system is independent of the shape, size and content of the room, provided that it is reverberant. Further development of this idea is discussed.},

This permits an analytical finite series solution for each of the elements of the E-field mode matching matrix [M] from which the scattering matrix [S] of the junction is easily obtained. Numerical evaluation of the S-parameters for the dominant TE/sub 10/ (rectangular) and TE/sub 11/ (circular) modes in the cases of junctions with no offset and with offset is presented. Moreover, the practical case of a circular cavity resonator with smaller input and output rectangular guides is considered and excellent agreement is found between the calculated and measured S-parameters.{$<>$}},

However, fewer proposals are found in acoustics, possibly due to the lack of a simple mechanism for coherent gain. In this paper, we propose a composite non-Hermitian system in acoustics consisting of assemblies of PT-symmetric Helmholtz resonator (HR) dipoles. Like meta-atoms are used as building elements in metamaterials, we propose PT-symmetric dipoles to design non-Hermitian systems intended to engineer complicated directivity fields. We theoretically analyze, numerically confirm, and experimentally show the symmetry breaking in a two-dimensional space of non-Hermitian dipoles consisting of a pair of Helmholtz resonators with different levels of gain and loss. In particular, we explore, as an application, a metastructure to concentrate the sound pressure inside the circular array formed by PT-symmetric dipoles. The proposed HR dipoles may be a convenient composite element for smart control of sound.},

It is shown that the same result may be obtained using only an N-point DFT of a reordered version of the original signal, with a resulting saving of 1/2. If the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to compute the DFT, the result is a fast cosine transform (FCT) that can be computed using on the order ofN \textbackslash log\_2 Nreal multiplications. The method is then extended to two dimensions, with a saving of 1/4 over the traditional method that uses the DFT.},

  abstract = {Air-coupled phased arrays are an increasing area of academic and industrial interest. Their application to acoustic levitation and mid-air haptics relies on high amplitude focussed fields capable of generating very high acoustic pressures (e.g. {$>$}150~dB SPL). At these elevated pressures non-linear propagation effects can become significant, for example: the generation of harmonic frequencies, waveform asymmetry and acoustic saturation. In this work the basics of non-linear acoustics are presented with emphasis on energy loss mechanisms. Experimental work shows non-linearities as a function of focussing distance and driving amplitude. Large 2D microphone scans normal and tangential to the acoustic axis are carried out. Comparisons to linear models are made as well as modification to saturation equations developed for water-coupled fields. It is shown that saturation losses can become significant at elevated transducer amplitudes and focal distances. Metrics such as the waveform asymmetry, total harmonic distortion and energy loss are used to show the onset and magnitude of non-linearities. The volumetric experimental data shows how the fundamental and harmonic fields can differ in amplitude sufficiently such that harmonic amplitudes can exceed the fundamental. Suggestions are made on how to identify non-linearities and their general effect on air-coupled arrays and their applications.},

Such systems, albeit linear, do not conserve frequency and require the adaptation of the usual theories and methods. In this paper, we provide a general extension of transmission line or telegraph equations to periodically time-modulated systems. As a by-product of the theory, we obtain a general approach to compute and measure the complete scattering matrix of such systems. Finally, the proposed theory and methods are applied and validated on a concrete practical example in the realm of airborne acoustics: a time-modulated actively controlled loudspeaker membrane terminating a monomode waveguide. Different modulation functions and parameters are tested. The experimental results are compared to both numerical simulation and an analytical model based on a two time-scale method.},

  abstract = {Exceptional points (EPs), at which both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, are ubiquitous and unique features of non-Hermitian systems. Second-order EPs are by far the most studied due to their abundance, requiring only the tuning of two real parameters, which is less than the three parameters needed to generically find ordinary Hermitian eigenvalue degeneracies. Higher-order EPs generically require more fine-tuning, and are thus assumed to play a much less prominent role. Here, however, we illuminate how physically relevant symmetries make higher-order EPs dramatically more abundant and conceptually richer. More saliently, third-order EPs generically require only two real tuning parameters in the presence of either a parity-time (PT) symmetry or a generalized chiral symmetry. Remarkably, we find that these different symmetries yield topologically distinct types of EPs. We illustrate our findings in simple models, and show how third-order EPs with a generic ∼k1/3 dispersion are protected by PT symmetry, while third-order EPs with a ∼k1/2 dispersion are protected by the chiral symmetry emerging in non-Hermitian Lieb lattice models. More generally, we identify stable, weak, and fragile aspects of symmetry-protected higher-order EPs, and tease out their concomitant phenomenology.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we face the problem of the scattering of a plane wave by a sphere embedded in an infinitely long circular cylinder. The problems of scattering by both a sphere and a cylinder are canonical problems in optics. However, the scattering problems involving different objects with different geometries have not been solved analytically in the literature: only asymptotic or approximated solutions are available. The problem of scattering by cylinders and spheres concurrently present can be of great importance in several areas, from optical microscopy to biomedical applications, and from metamaterials to civil engineering applications. To solve the problem, the incident wave is expressed as a superposition of cylindrical harmonics. The scattered wave by the cylinder, being a cylindrical wave as well, has been expressed as a superposition of spherical harmonics in order to take into account the interaction with the sphere. The theoretical procedure returns a linear system of equations for the computation of the unknown coefficients of the series. A numerical code is presented to compute the scattered field, where a suitable truncation criterion for the series expansions has been proposed. Comparisons with a finite-element method have been presented to validate the results.}

The axial components of the electromagnetic fields inside an anisotropic elliptic cylinder are represented as two coupled integrals of suitable eigenfunctions in elliptic coordinates in terms of Mathieu functions. Scattering by an anisotropic elliptic cylinder is different from scattering by a sphere or a circular cylinder because of the nonorthogonality properties of Mathieu functions at the interface between two different media. In order to solve this problem, Galerkin's method is applied to the boundary conditions to solve the unknown coefficients. Numerical results are presented, discussed, and compared with available data.}

Thus, we experimentally demonstrate a new technique to perform wave computation in the group of integer Z. When the two vortices have commensurable frequencies, different combinations give the same frequencies but different tolopological charges may occur. We show that an energy criterion can be used to predict the outcome. A corollary is that a modulation of amplitude of the vortices switches from one result to the other.},

  abstract = {We discuss an operational scheme for measuring the power extinguished by a single particle in terms of physical energy fluxes. Illumination by an infinite plane wave and a collimated Gaussian beam is considered. For the case of a collimated beam, consideration of extinguished power presents an apparent paradox, which is resolved in this paper. It is then shown that the extinguished power is measurable as a flow of energy for a narrow, collimated incident beam and a small scatterer. In this case, the extinguished power is simply removed from the transmitted beam. If we relax the above assumptions, definition of the extinguished power in terms of measurable energy fluxes is still possible but becomes more nuanced.},

  abstract = {An expression is derived for the radiation force on a sphere placed on the axis of an ideal acoustic Bessel beam propagating in an inviscid fluid. The expression uses the partial-wave coefficients found in the analysis of the scattering when the sphere is placed in a plane wave traveling in the same external fluid. The Bessel beam is characterized by the cone angle beta of its plane wave components where beta=0 gives the limiting case of an ordinary plane wave. Examples are found for fluid spheres where the radiation force reverses in direction so the force is opposite the direction of the beam propagation. Negative axial forces are found to be correlated with conditions giving reduced backscattering by the beam. This condition may also be helpful in the design of acoustic tweezers for biophysical applications. Other potential applications include the manipulation of objects in microgravity. Islands in the (ka, beta) parameter plane having a negative radiation force are calculated for the case of a hexane drop in water. Here k is the wave number and a is the drop radius. Low frequency approximations to the radiation force are noted for rigid, fluid, and elastic solid spheres in an inviscid fluid.},

The beam considered is an example of a helicoidal beam where "helicoidal" refers to a type of beam that possesses an axial null and has an azimuthal phase gradient. This type of beam is sometimes also referred to as an acoustic vortex. The beam considered here has a phase ramp equal to the azimuthal angle. In agreement with symmetry arguments given previously, the backward scattering and forward scattering vanish for all frequencies. Some of the resulting modifications of the scattering are illustrated for a rigid sphere and an evacuated steel shell in water.

The term "helicoidal" refers to a type of beam having an axial amplitude null and an azimuthal phase gradient. Such a beam is known as an acoustic vortex and only the case of a vortex having a unit magnitude topological charge is considered. There is no monopole contribution to the radiation force. Radiation force examples are computed for a soft sphere, a fixed rigid sphere, a movable rigid sphere, an aluminum sphere in water, and an acrylic sphere in water. Beam parameters are found for the rigid sphere and the aluminum and acrylic cases in which the radiation force is directed opposite the propagation direction of the beam. Negative radiation forces appear to be associated with relatively weak scattering into the backward hemisphere. Some aspects of the low frequency scattering of plane waves and helicoidal Bessel beams are examined for movable rigid spheres.}

The superposition (which is an exact solution of the Helmholtz equation) has the important property that the scattering by an isotropic sphere can be calculated without any approximations for the commonly considered case of linear waves propagating in an inviscid fluid. The nth partial wave amplitude is similar to the case of plane-wave illumination except for a weighting factor that depends on incomplete gamma functions. An approximation for the weighting factor is also discussed based on a generalization of the Van de Hulst localization principle for a sphere of radius a at the focus of a Gaussian beam. Examples display differences between the directionality of the scattering with the plane wave case even though for the cases displayed, ka does not exceed 2 and w(0)a is not less than 2.

With the exception of a few local resonances spanning very narrow band windows, we find that for common elastic materials the shells are indistinguishable from their effective fluid counterparts for wavelengths larger than the shell's outer diameter. Furthermore, we find that when the elastic shell is composed of a material with impedance larger than water, there will be a specific shell thickness for which the effective fluid properties become impedance-matched. Finally, we demonstrate that the shells can be used as constituent components in regular lattices to create homogenized acoustic metamaterial devices.}

  abstract = {Accurately representing the behavior of acoustic sources is an important part of ultrasound simulation. This is particularly challenging in ultrasound therapy where multielement arrays are often used. Typically, sources are defined as a boundary condition over a 2-D plane within the computational model. However, this approach can become difficult to apply to arrays with multiple elements distributed over a nonplanar surface. In this paper, a grid-based discrete source model for single- and multielement bowl-shaped transducers is developed to model the source geometry explicitly within a regular Cartesian grid. For each element, the source model is defined as a symmetric, simply connected surface with a single grid point thickness. Simulations using the source model with the open-source k-Wave toolbox are validated using the Rayleigh integral, O'Neil solution, and experimental measurements of a focused bowl transducer under both quasi-continuous wave and pulsed excitations. Close agreement is shown between the discrete bowl model and the axial pressure predicted by the O'Neil solution for a uniform curved radiator, even at very low grid resolutions. Excellent agreement is also shown between the discrete bowl model and experimental measurements. To accurately reproduce the near-field pressure measured experimentally, it is necessary to derive the drive signal at each grid point of the bowl model directly using holography. However, good agreement is also obtained in the focal region using uniformly radiating monopole sources distributed over the bowl surface. This allows the response of multielement transducers to be modeled, even where measurement of an input plane is not possible.},

However, many existing measurement devices are unable to withstand the extreme pressures generated in these fields, and those that can often exhibit low sensitivity. Here, a planar Fabry-Pérot interferometer with hard dielectric mirrors and spacer was designed, fabricated, and characterized, and its suitability for measurement of nonlinear focused ultrasound fields was investigated. The noise equivalent pressure (NEP) of the scanning system scaled with the adjustable pressure detection range between 49 kPa for pressures up to 8 MPa and 152 kPa for measurements up to 25 MPa, over a 125 MHz measurement bandwidth. Measurements of the frequency response of the sensor showed that it varied by less than 3 dB in the range 1-62 MHz. The effective element size of the sensor was 65 μm and waveforms were acquired at a rate of 200 Hz. The device was used to measure the acoustic pressure in the field of a 1.1 MHz single-element spherically focused bowl transducer. Measurements of the acoustic field at low pressures compared well with measurements made using a Polyvinylidene difluoride needle hydrophone. At high pressures, the measured peak focal pressures agreed well with the focal pressure modeled using the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation. Maximum peak positive pressures of 25 MPa and peak negative pressures of 12 MPa were measured, and planar field scans were acquired in scan times on the order of 1 min. The properties of the sensor and scanning system are well suited to measurement of nonlinear focused ultrasound fields, in both the focal region and the low-pressure peripheral regions. The fast acquisition speed of the system and its low NEP are advantageous, and with further development of the sensor, it has potential in application to HIFU metrology.},

In this study, the repeatability of measurements made with four probe and membrane hydrophones was examined. The pressures measured by these hydrophones in three different ultrasound fields, with both linear and nonlinear, pulsed and steady state driving conditions, were compared to assess the reproducibility of measurements. The coefficient of variation of the focal peak positive pressure was less than 2\% for all hydrophones across five repeated measurements. When comparing hydrophones, pressures measured in a spherically focused 1.1\,MHz field were within 7\% for all except 1 case, and within 10\% for a broadband 5\,MHz pulse from a diagnostic linear array. Larger differences of up to 55\% were observed between measurements of a tightly focused 3.3\,MHz field, which were reduced for some hydrophones by the application of spatial averaging corrections. Overall, the major source of these differences was spatial averaging and uncertainty in the complex frequency response of the hydrophones.},

  abstract = {Models of ultrasound propagation in biologically relevant media have applications in planning and verification of ultrasound therapies and computational dosimetry. To be effective, the models must be able to accurately predict both the spatial distribution and amplitude of the acoustic pressure. This requires that the models are validated in absolute terms, which for arbitrarily heterogeneous media should be performed by comparison with measurements of the acoustic field. In this article, simulations performed using the open-source k-Wave acoustics toolbox, with a measurement-based source definition, were quantitatively validated against measurements of acoustic pressure in water and layered absorbing fluid media. In water, the measured and simulated spatial-peak pressures agreed to within 3\% under linear conditions and 7\% under nonlinear conditions. After propagation through a planar or wedge-shaped glycerol-filled phantom, the difference in spatial-peak pressure was 8.5\% and 10.7\%, respectively. These differences are within or close to the expected uncertainty of the acoustic pressure measurement. The -6 dB width and length of the focus agreed to within 4\% in all cases, and the focal positions were within 0.7 mm for the planar phantom and 1.2 mm for the wedge-shaped phantom. These results demonstrate that when the acoustic medium properties and geometry are well known, accurate quantitative predictions of the acoustic field can be made using k-Wave.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to investigate a variety of effects linking the auditory distance perception of virtual sound sources to the context of audio-only augmented reality (AAR) applications. It focuses on how its specific perceptual context and primary objectives impose constraints on the design of the distance rendering approach used to generate virtual sound sources for AAR applications. AAR refers to a set of technologies that aim to merge computer-generated auditory content into a user's acoustic environment. AAR systems have fundamental requirements as an audio playback system must enable a seamless integration of virtual sound events within the user's environment. Different challenges arise from these critical requirements. The first part of the thesis concerns the critical role of acoustic cue reproduction in the auditory distance perception of virtual sound sources in the context of audio-only augmented reality. Auditory distance perception is based on a range of cues categorized as acoustic, and cognitive. We examined which strategies for weighting auditory cues are used by the auditory system to create the perception of sound distance. By considering different spatial and temporal segmentations, we attempted to characterize how early energy is perceived in relation to reverberation. The second part of the thesis's motivations focuses on how, in AAR applications, environment-related cues could impact the perception of virtual sound sources. In AAR applications, the geometry of the environment is not always completely considered. In particular, the calibration effect induced by the perception of the visual environment on the auditory perception is generally overlooked. We also became interested in the instance in which co-occurring real sound sources whose placements are unknown to the user could affect the auditory distance perception of virtual sound sources through an intra-modal calibration effect.},

This article introduces a new ultrasound-based powder focusing method referred to as ultrasound particle lensing (UPL), tailored for powder used in DED-PF. The method uses an ultrasound phased array to produce a small volume of high-intensity ultrasound with the required period averaged sound intensity profile. UPL was used to acoustically focus streams of Ti64 and SS 316L particles with an average size of 89μm and a particle speed of 0.6~m/s, exiting from a DED-PF nozzle analog. The e−1 powder stream widths downstream of the resulting force fields for both materials were reduced by 30\%. The experimental results closely match Lagrangian and Eulerian simulations of the process. This novel setup offers the possibility of fast control of the powder stream divergence angle and effective diameter in the process zone during the DED-PF process. This will in turn improve the feature resolution and catchment efficiency of the process.},

This allows us to manipulate cells, liquids, compounds or living things without touching or contaminating them. However, acoustic levitation has required the targets to be enclosed with acoustic elements or had limited manoeuvrability. Here we optimize the phases used to drive an ultrasonic phased array and show that acoustic levitation can be employed to translate, rotate and manipulate particles using even a single-sided emitter. Furthermore, we introduce the holographic acoustic elements framework that permits the rapid generation of traps and provides a bridge between optical and acoustical trapping. Acoustic structures shaped as tweezers, twisters or bottles emerge as the optimum mechanisms for tractor beams or containerless transportation. Single-beam levitation could manipulate particles inside our body for applications in targeted drug delivery or acoustically controlled micro-machines that do not interfere with magnetic resonance imaging.},

  abstract = {Acoustic tweezers use sound radiation forces to manipulate matter without contact. They provide unique characteristics compared with the more established optical tweezers, such as higher trapping forces per unit input power and the ability to manipulate objects from the micrometer to the centimeter scale. They also enable the trapping of a wide range of sample materials in various media. A dramatic advancement in optical tweezers was the development of holographic optical tweezers (HOT) which enabled the independent manipulation of multiple particles leading to applications such as the assembly of 3D microstructures and the probing of soft matter. Now, 20 years after the development of HOT, we present the realization of holographic acoustic tweezers (HAT). We experimentally demonstrate a 40-kHz airborne HAT system implemented using two 256-emitter phased arrays and manipulate individually up to 25 millimetric particles simultaneously. We show that the maximum trapping forces are achieved once the emitting array satisfies Nyquist sampling and an emission phase discretization below π/8 radians. When considered on the scale of a wavelength, HAT provides similar manipulation capabilities as HOT while retaining its unique characteristics. The examples shown here suggest the future use of HAT for novel forms of displays in which the objects are made of physical levitating voxels, assembly processes in the micrometer and millimetric scale, as well as positioning and orientation of multiple objects which could lead to biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {Large-scale simulation of ultrasonic pulse propagation in inhomogeneous tissue is important for the study of ultrasound-tissue interaction as well as for development of new imaging methods. Typical scales of interest span hundreds of wavelengths. This paper presents a simplified derivation of the k-space method for a medium of variable sound speed and density; the derivation clearly shows the relationship of this k-space method to both past k-space methods and pseudospectral methods. In the present method, the spatial differential equations are solved by a simple Fourier transform method, and temporal iteration is performed using a k-t space propagator. The temporal iteration procedure is shown to be exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for "slow" (c(x)/spl les/c/sub 0/) media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. The applicability of the k-space method to large-scale soft tissue modeling is shown by simulating two-dimensional propagation of an incident plane wave through several tissue-mimicking cylinders as well as a model chest wall cross section. A three-dimensional implementation of the k-space method is also employed for the example problem of propagation through a tissue-mimicking sphere. Numerical results indicate that the k-space method is accurate for large-scale soft tissue computations with much greater efficiency than that of an analogous leapfrog pseudospectral method or a 2-4 finite difference time-domain method. However, numerical results also indicate that the k-space method is less accurate than the finite-difference method for a high contrast scatterer with bone-like properties, although qualitative results can still be obtained by the k-space method with high efficiency. Possible extensions to the method, including representation of absorption effects, absorbing boundary conditions, elastic-wave propagation, and acoustic nonlinearity, are discussed.},

  abstract = {In modern ultrasound imaging devices, two-dimensional probes and electronic scanning allow volumetric imaging of anatomical structures. When dealing with the design of such complex 3-D ultrasound (US) systems, as the number of transducers and channels dramatically increases, new challenges concerning the integration of electronics and the implementation of smart micro-beamforming strategies arise. Hence, the possibility to predict the behavior of the whole system is mandatory. In this paper, we propose and describe an advanced simulation tool for ultrasound system modeling and simulation, which conjugates the US propagation and scattering, signal transduction, electronic signal conditioning, and beamforming in a single environment. In particular, we present the architecture and model of an existing 16-channel integrated receiver, which includes an amplification and micro-beamforming stage, and validate it by comparison with circuit simulations. The developed model is then used in conjunction with the transducer and US field models to perform a system simulation, aimed at estimating the performance of an example 3-D US imaging system that uses a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) 2-D phased-array coupled to the modeled reception front-end. Results of point spread function (PSF) calculations, as well as synthetic imaging of a virtual phantom, show that this tool is actually able to model the complete US image reconstruction process, and that it could be used to quickly provide valuable system-level feedback for an optimized tuning of electronic design parameters.},

We first review a theorem well known in electromagnetism and optics but underappreciated in acoustics and phonon physics, stating that the matrix of R–T coefficients for properly normalized amplitudes is symmetric for linear systems that conform to power conservation and time reversibility for wave fields. It is shown that linear structures hitherto proposed for ‘acoustic diodes’ in fact do obey R–T reciprocity, and thus should not strictly be called diodes or isolators. We also review examples of nonlinear designs violating reciprocity, and conclude that an efficient acoustic isolator has not yet been demonstrated. Finally, we consider the relationship between acoustic isolators and ‘thermal diodes’, and show that ballistic phonon transport through a linear structure, whether an acoustic diode or not, is unlikely to form the basis for a thermal diode.},

The key objective is to examine a canonical problem: how to predict the pressure field due to a distributed source located near an infinite, rigid cylinder. This canonical problem is a simple representation of an installed turbofan, where the distributed source is based on the pressure pattern generated by a spinning duct mode, and the rigid cylinder represents an aircraft fuselage. The radiation of fan tones can be modelled in terms of spinning modes. In this analysis, based on duct modes, theoretical expressions for the near-field acoustic pressures on the cylinder, or at the same locations without the cylinder, have been formulated. Simulations of the near-field acoustic pressures are compared against measurements obtained from a fan rig test. Also, the installation effect is quantified by calculating the difference in the sound pressure levels with and without the adjacent cylindrical fuselage. Results are shown for the blade passing frequency fan tone radiated at a supersonic fan operating condition.},

While this method is functional, it can be inefficient because many of the commonly used mathematical operations are either redundant or unnecessary. This paper addresses these two inefficiencies by proposing both the use of look-up tables to prevent redundant calculations, and the use of a sorting method to allow the prevention of unnecessary calculations. Either technique, by itself, results in a large reduction in computation time. The greatest time reductions, however, can be achieved when both techniques are used together.},

They are difficult to evaluate using standard numerical techniques, because of their slowly decreasing oscillatory form. The authors derive an analytic expression for the infinite integral of three spherical Bessel functions. They then use this result, together with the closure relation for spherical Bessel functions, to show how in principle one can derive an analytic expression for the integral of any number of spherical Bessel functions. They demonstrate this by deriving an analytic expression for the integral of four spherical Bessel functions. As with all of these analytic formulae, the results require that all angular momenta corresponding to the spherical Bessel functions can be coupled together to give an overall scalar quantity and conserve parity. The authors discuss the numerical accuracy and stability of this procedure.},

We investigated primary and secondary outcome measures: i) temporary threshold shift (TTS), defined as {$>$}10 dB shift in pure tone air conduction thresholds and/or a decrement in distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) {$>$}10 dB at two or more frequencies; ii) presence of new-onset otologic symptoms after exposure. Twenty adult subjects with normal hearing underwent a pre-exposure assessment (pure tone air conduction audiometry, tympanometry, DPOAEs and otologic symptoms questionnaire) followed by exposure to a 2-h movie with sound delivered through the HSS emitter followed by a post-exposure assessment. No TTS or new-onset otological symptoms were identified. HSS demonstrates excellent safety in normal hearing subjects under normal use conditions.},

Here we present a thin-film acoustic metamaterial, comprising an elastic membrane decorated with asymmetric rigid platelets that aims to totally absorb low-frequency airborne sound at selective resonance frequencies ranging from 100–1,000 Hz. Our samples can reach almost unity absorption at frequencies where the relevant sound wavelength in air is three orders of magnitude larger than the membrane thickness. At resonances, the flapping motion of the rigid platelets leads naturally to large elastic curvature energy density at their perimeter regions. As the flapping motions couple only minimally to the radiation modes, the overall energy density in the membrane can be two-to-three orders of magnitude larger than the incident wave energy density at low frequencies, forming in essence an open cavity.},

  abstract = {A general design paradigm for a novel type of acoustic metasurface is proposed by introducing periodically repeated supercells on a rigid thin plate, where each supercell contains multiple cut-through slits that are filled with materials possessing different refractive indices but the same impedance as that of the host medium. When the wavelength of the incident wave is smaller than the periodicity, the direction of the transmitted wave with nearly unity transmittance can be chosen by engineering the phase discontinuities along the transverse direction. When the wavelength is larger than the periodicity, even though the metasurface is impedance matched to the host medium, most of the incident energy is reflected back and the remaining portion is converted into a surface-bound mode. We show that both the transmitted wave control and the high reflection with the surface mode excitation can be interpreted by a unified analytic model based on mode-coupling theory. Our general design principle not only supplies the functionalities of reflection-type acoustic metasurfaces, but also exhibits unprecedented flexibility and efficiency in various domains of wave manipulation for possible applications in fields like refracting, collimating, focusing or absorbing wave energy.},

The method is characterized by a great versatility because it is designed for rooms of an arbitrary shape. An applied theoretical model utilizes a modal representation of the room im-pulse response obtained by solving 3-dimensional wave equation within a room subjected to a time impulse forcing. The method allows to determine steady-state energetic acoustic quantities, such as the potential and kinetic energy densities and the active and reactive sound intensities. It also enables to predict a decaying sound field inside a room and room reverberant characteristics. Two kinds of reverberant response were considered. In the first case, the room response was initiated by the pure-tone point source and a beginning of the reverberation process occurred just after turning off the source. In the second case, the room was excited by Dirac delta time impulse emitted by the point source. In this case, the numerical technique known as the Schroeder backward integration was ap-plied to determine decay curves. This procedure allows a simple calculation of the decay times and enables to predict other reverberant parameters used for the objective evaluation of room acoustics such as the definition, the clarity index, the centre time and the early and late lateral energy fractions.},

  abstract = {A small rectangular room with hard walls has a number of acoustic flaws and the most serious drawback is a long reverberation time. A technique commonly used for improving room acoustics consists in increasing a sound absorption on a ceiling. In this study, the impact of acoustical treatment of a ceiling on reverberant properties of a small rectangular room was examined. Changes in the modal reverberation time due to this treatment were investigated by the analytical method. As was evidenced by calculations, the initial increase in a sound absorption on a ceiling causes a substantial decrease in the modal reverberation time and a treatment efficiency decreases with a further absorption increase. It was found also that for a room with hard walls statistical and wave theories give the same result as the modal reverberation time for oblique modes and the Sabine’s reverberation time are identical. A more detailed information about reverberant properties of a room was provided by the numerical method employing a backward integration of the squared room impulse response. Using this method, global and local reverberation parameters were determined. Numerical simulations discovered a quite good agreement between global and local reverberation time and high differences between global and local early decay time resulting from a nonlinear shape of a decay curve. Therefore, one can conclude that the global decay times characterize reasonably well a reverberation process in a late stage of sound decay but they are not correctly describe this process in an initial stage.},

For a harmonic excitation, calculation results revealed high impact of a frequency and a sound damping on a distribution of the steady-state pressure amplitude. They also indicated irregularly located energy vortices in the active intensity vector field. Simulations of a transient sound field were carried out for a boundary excitation producing a sine wave pulse. Temporal changes in this field were studied using the pressure amplitude determined via the discrete Hilbert transform. A large temporal variability of a distribution of this amplitude was noted due to a strong dependence of a transient sound on a position of the observation point. Simulation results also shown that for a small sound damping on cavity walls, there was an intense sound reverberation inside the cavity.},

  abstract = {Acoustic waves exert forces when they interact with matter. Shaping ultrasound fields precisely in 3D thus allows control over the force landscape and should permit particulates to fall into place to potentially form whole 3D objects in “one shot.” This is promising for rapid prototyping, most notably biofabrication, since conventional methods are typically slow and apply mechanical or chemical stress on biological cells. Here, we realize the generation of compact holographic ultrasound fields and demonstrate the one-step assembly of matter using acoustic forces. We combine multiple holographic fields that drive the contactless assembly of solid microparticles, hydrogel beads, and biological cells inside standard labware. The structures can be fixed via gelation of the surrounding medium. In contrast to previous work, this approach handles matter with positive acoustic contrast and does not require opposing waves, supporting surfaces or scaffolds. We envision promising applications of 3D holographic ultrasound fields in tissue engineering and additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to model a circular planar loudspeaker placed near a spherical reflector to broaden its directivity pattern, which would otherwise become increasingly narrow at high frequencies. Through ray tracing, it seems intuitively feasible to thus create a virtual point source at very high frequencies, but we provide a more rigorous analysis to determine what will happen at intermediate frequencies where the wavelength is of a similar magnitude to the diameter of the disk or sphere. We show that a smoother off-axis response is obtained with a dipole pressure source, which does not obstruct the scattered sound, rather than a monopole velocity source. Hence, an electrostatic loudspeaker, for example, would be more suitable than a dynamic one. The sphere may also serve as a spherical approximation of a human head, in which case the loudspeaker would become an open headphone that is not sealed to the ear.},

  abstract = {The recently proposed bianisotropic acoustic metagratings offer promising opportunities for passive acoustic wavefront manipulation, which is of particular interest in flat acoustic lenses and ultrasound imaging at ultra-high frequency ultrasound. Despite this fact, acoustic metagratings have never been scaled to MHz frequencies that are common in ultrasound imaging. One of the greatest challenges is the production of complex microscopic structures. Owing to two-photon polymerization, a novel fabrication technique from the view of acoustic metamaterials, it is now possible to precisely manufacture sub-wavelength structures in this frequency range. However, shrinking in size poses another challenge; the increasing thermoviscous effects lead to a drop in efficiency and a frequency downshift of the transmission peak and must therefore be taken into account in the design. In this work three microacoustic metagrating designs refracting a normally incident wave toward −35° at 2 MHz are proposed. In order to develop meta-atoms insensitive to thermoviscous effects shape optimization techniques incorporating the linearized Navier–Stokes equations discretized with finite element method are used. The authors report for the first time microscopic acoustic metamaterials manufactured using two-photon polymerization and, subsequently, experimentally verify their effectiveness using an optical microphone as a detector in a range from 1.8 to 2.2 MHz.},

The current approaches use fixed lenses or expensive phased arrays. Here, using a process of analogue-to-digital conversion and wavelet decomposition, we develop the notion of quantal meta-surfaces. The quanta here are small, pre-manufactured three-dimensional units—which we call metamaterial bricks—each encoding a specific phase delay. These bricks can be assembled into meta-surfaces to generate any diffraction-limited acoustic field. We apply this methodology to show experimental examples of acoustic focusing, steering and, after stacking single meta-surfaces into layers, the more complex field of an acoustic tractor beam. We demonstrate experimentally single-sided air-borne acoustic levitation using meta-layers at various bit-rates: from a 4-bit uniform to 3-bit non-uniform quantization in phase. This powerful methodology dramatically simplifies the design of acoustic devices and provides a key-step towards realizing spatial sound modulators.},

  abstract = {25 years of 3 D ultrasound in prenatal diagnosis represent an important milestone in recent ultrasound history. The initial stages of 3 D ultrasound were anything but easy. Although there were reports of initial experimental in-vitro ultrasound studies as early as the 1970s and 1980s 1 2, clinical use did not begin until the first commercial 3 D ultrasound unit (Combison 330, Kretztechnik Zipf, Austria) was introduced in 1989 (Fig. 1) 3 4. With this unit it became possible for the first time to produce so-called multiplanar (= triplanar) images. This means that it was possible to display the three orthogonal two-dimensional image planes at the same time on the monitor (Fig. 2). Volume acquisition via a relatively large abdominal 3 D probe, which – in contrast to the 2 D probe – had to be held at a right angle to acquire a longitudinal scan, was unfamiliar (Fig. 3a, b). In contrast to the abdominal 3 D probe that acquired a pyramid-shaped volume with motor-controlled mechanical fan-shaped sweep of the scanning plane, a rotation method was selected for the volume acquisition with the 3 D vaginal probe for reasons of space. However, this had the disadvantage of central overlapping of all sectional planes resulting in limited image quality at the center (Fig. 3c, d). This disadvantage could not be eliminated until it became possible to perform a motor-controlled mechanical fan-shaped sweep of the imaging plane for volume acquisition with the 3 D vaginal probe. The introduction of the so-called surface mode made it possible to visualize surface images of the fetus and embryo with an abdominal as well as a vaginal 3 D probe. Due to the substantial processing power that this required, it initially (1992) took 6 hours to create one surface image with an external computer. Today a surface rendering of one image takes between 20 and 50 milliseconds depending on the volume.   Parallel to this so-called internal or integrated system in which the complete 3 D unit is permanently integrated in the ultrasound unit and the 3 D probes are matched to the system (Fig. 4) 5, so-called external 3 D systems (e. g. TomTec, Echotech, InViVo-System), in which acquisitions can be performed using any conventional 2 D probe, were also developed 5. An electromagnetic position sensor must simply be attached to the probe so that the transducer position and movements can be recorded on the basis of changes in the magnetic field (Fig. 4). After transfer of the individual 2 D images to a workstation, the images and their individual positions are assembled by a computer program to form a volume. The disadvantage of external systems is that the distances between the individual two-dimensional image planes are usually not identical due to the manual probe guidance, resulting in a lower volume quality, and that 4 D display is not possible 5.  Due to the initial problems with 3 D ultrasound, many experienced 2 D ultrasound operators were initially skeptical of this new technique. Therefore, 3 D ultrasound was viewed as a difficult, inconvenient, and unnecessary method. Typical questions that were repeatedly asked included 4: Is 3 D ultrasound more useful in prenatal diagnosis? Does it improve diagnostic accuracy or is it only good for keepsake images? Can we detect more malformations? Is it useful in the daily routine or is it only time-consuming? This technique continues to be inexplicably disqualified by some examiners as baby television even though three-dimensional ultrasound has found broad use in obstetric diagnosis.  There is no doubt that 3 D ultrasound has become widely globally available since the first World Congress on 3 D Ultrasound on September 5 – 6, 1997 in Mainz, Germany (Fig. 5). Different technical developments, such as simplification of operation, faster image rendering due to greater computer processing power, and significant improvement in image quality, contributed to this. Every high-end ultrasound unit is currently equipped with such a technique. Moreover, an increasing number of publications regarding the use of 3 D ultrasound in prenatal diagnosis have appeared since 1997 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30. However, proper use of 3 D ultrasound entails a learning curve of several months. Technical know-how, spatial reasoning, and continuous training are helpful for those learning the technique. Finally it must be taken into consideration that every 3 D ultrasound is based on 2 D ultrasound 21 and that high quality 3 D surface images can thus only be achieved in the case of good 2 D image quality and if the fetus is surrounded by sufficient amniotic fluid and there are no obstructing structures 5.  A 3 D examination generally consists of four main steps: 1. volume acquisition, 2. 3 D visualization, 3: volume/image processing and 4. storing of volumes/images/sequences 5.  In contrast to 2 D ultrasound, 3 D ultrasound provides a number of imaging modes and image processing techniques (Table 1) that are used in prenatal diagnosis depending on the particular issue.  With triplanar imaging, all planes can be reconstructed and visualized from one volume and special planes can be controlled in a precise manner on the basis of the two other orthogonal imaging planes. An enormous improvement in image quality has been able to be achieved in the last 2 decades in particular with regard to surface images as well as transparent images ( Fig. 6). Moreover, 4 D ultrasound made it possible to display fetal movements in surface and transparent mode as in a video.  3 D/4 D technology has become a valuable supplementary method to conventional 2 D ultrasound in the diagnosis of malformations and can be used by skilled ultrasound operators to clarify suspicious findings in a targeted manner. As a result, the nuchal translucency and nasal bone can be precisely measured in the first trimester. Complex organs, such as the fetal heart 8 10 18 22 24 and the fetal brain 7 19 23 25 26, can be precisely examined tomographically in the second and third trimesters. Heart defects as well as vascular anomalies can be visualized three-dimensionally using color Doppler 18 27 28. 3 D neurosonography is playing an increasingly important role in the detection or exclusion of brain malformations since all planes can be precisely set and an exact comparison between the left and right brain hemispheres is also possible. In the surface mode surface defects of the fetal head (cleft lip and palate/encephalocele) or in other body regions (spina bifida, defects of the abdominal wall or extremities) can be precisely detected 6 9 12 21. Moreover, skeletal changes or ossification defects can be clearly detected with the X-ray-like imaging of the fetal skeleton in the transparent mode 12 13. The detection of subtle changes in fetuses opens up completely new possibilities in the diagnosis of chromosomal disorders 13 and syndromes some of which can only be detected on the basis of discrete sonoanatomical changes.  Particularly in the case of the exclusion of fetal malformations, such as facial defects, 4 D surface imaging is an ideal method to reassure parents-to-be since they can personally see fetal movements as well as the normal finding on the monitor 4. Seeing surface images of the fetal face is certainly one of the most impressive moments of the ultrasound examination for parents-to-be. However, providing parents with nice pictures of their unborn child is not the main goal of the examination but rather a byproduct 31.  A further significant advantage of 3 D ultrasound for the examiner is that three-dimensional structures are not only shown three dimensionally but can also be digitally stored without loss in the form of 3 D images, volumes, or 3 D sequences 16. The digital storage of volumes permits virtual examinations, i. e., volumes can be reloaded at any time and examined in the absence of the patient 16 21. With the help of a special computer program, all stored volumes can also be loaded onto a PC or Notebook and can thus be examined independently of the ultrasound unit. From an educational standpoint, the digital storing and rendering of volumetric data represents a new approach in medical education. Reviewing copies of a stored volume allows several trainees to be taught at the same time to recognize the fetal anatomy hidden within the volume 4 16.  25 years after the introduction of three-dimensional ultrasound in clinical diagnostics, 3 D/4 D ultrasound provides such a broad diagnostic spectrum in the daily routine that it has become a fixture in targeted prenatal diagnosis as well as in the clarification of gynecological findings 21 32 33 34 35, pelvic floor defects 36, and in breast diagnostics 37. The same is also true for various other areas of specialization 38 39 40.  The recently introduced ultrasound device E10 from GE, which uses a fully electronic abdominal probe (matrix probe) and the HDlive Silhouette visualization mode to provide even more impressive ultrasound images of embryonic/fetal development than previously possible, shows that the field of 3 D/4 D ultrasound is continuing to advance. Further developments in the field of computer technology will certainly help to ensure future innovations on the part of ultrasound device manufacturers.},

  abstract = {The noise which is caused by vibration of steel plate girders of a motorway is studied. This type of noise is often referred to as elevated structure noise, and has its main component within the frequency range 500 Hz±1 kHz. Since a steel plate girder can be considered as a rectangular plate with an extreme aspect ratio, the sound ®eld radiated by a baed elastic plate strip of in®nite length, which is the simplest model of a steel plate girder, was theoretically analysed in the preceding paper (Sakagami, K., Michishita, K., Morimoto, M., and Kitamura, Y. Sound radiation from a baed elastic plate strip of in®nite length with various concentrated exitation forces. Appl Acoust 55: 181±202). However, a real motorway construction is more appropriately modelled by an unbaed strip. Thus the unbaed condition has been analysed numerically in this paper. The method of equivalent sources is used. The main features of the radiated sound ®eld are discussed in the light of numerical examples, and compared with those of a baed strip. Two vibration patterns, i.e. an idealised piston vibration and ¯exural vibration excited by a moment are considered. Furthermore, in order to determine the far-®eld range of an in®nitely long plate, the variation of the radiated sound ®eld with the distance is discussed. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {In this paper, we suggest a new perspective, where Newton's second law of motion is replaced by a more general law which is a better approximation for describing the motion of seemingly rigid macroscopic bodies. We confirm a finding of Willis that the density of a body at a given frequency of oscillation can be anisotropic. The relation between the force and the acceleration is non-local (but causal) in time. Conversely, for every response function satisfying these properties, and having the appropriate high-frequency limit, there is a model which realizes that response function. In many circumstances, the differences between Newton's second law and the new law are small, but there are circumstances, such as in specially designed composite materials, where the difference is enormous. For bodies which are not seemingly rigid, the continuum equations of elastodynamics govern behaviour and also need to be modified. The modified versions of these equations presented here are a generalization of the equations proposed by Willis to describe elastodynamics in composite materials. It is argued that these new sets of equations may apply to all physical materials, not just composites. The Willis equations govern the behaviour of the average displacement field whereas one set of new equations governs the behaviour of the average-weighted displacement field, where the weighted displacement field may attach zero weight to ‘hidden’ areas in the material where the displacement may be unobservable or not defined. From knowledge of the average-weighted displacement field, one obtains an approximate formula for the ensemble averaged energy density. Two other sets of new equations govern the behaviour when the microstructure has microinertia, i.e. where there are internal spinning masses below the chosen scale of continuum modelling. In the first set, the average displacement field is assumed to be observable, while in the second set an average-weighted displacement field is assumed to be observable.},

The limit is a certain simple universal function of the incident light wave number, and the multipolarity of the corresponding partial mode solely. It does not depend on the optical constants of the scatterer, its size, or even its shape. First, we obtain this result for the scattering by a spherical particle. Then, we generalize it to an arbitrary finite obstacle. The results are valid for any polarization of the incident wave, any angle of its incidence, and any type of the scatterer (homogeneous, stratified, or with smoothly variable refractive index). We also prove that the maximal partial absorption cross section for any finite scatterer cannot exceed the corresponding value for a homogeneous sphere in 3D and circular cylinder in 2D. As an example, the results are applied to maximize the absorption cross section of a spherical core-shell structure.}

A standing or a quasistanding acoustic field is the result of counter propagating 2 equal or unequal amplitude zero-order Bessel beams, respectively, along the same axis. Each Bessel beam is characterized by its halfcone angle beta(l);l = 1, 2 of its plane wave components, such that beta(l) = 0 represents a plane wave. Analytical expressions of RF are derived for a homogeneous viscoelastic sphere chosen as an example. RF calculations for a polyethylene sphere immersed in water are performed. Particularly, the half-cone angle dependency on the RF is analyzed for standing and quasistanding waves. Changing the half-cone angle is equivalent to changing the beamwidth.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Particle manipulation using the acoustic radiation force of Bessel beams is an active field of research. In a previous investigation, [F.G. Mitri, Acoustic radiation force on a sphere in standing and quasi-standing zero-order Bessel beam tweezers, Annals of Physics 323 (2008) 1604-1620] an expression for the radiation force of a zero-order Bessel beam standing wave experienced by a sphere was derived. The present work extends the analysis of the radiation force to the case of a high-order Bessel beam (HOBB) of positive order m having an angular dependence on the phase phi. METHOD: The derivation for the general expression of the force is based on the formulation for the total acoustic scattering field of a HOBB by a sphere [F.G. Mitri, Acoustic scattering of a high-order Bessel beam by an elastic sphere, Annals of Physics 323 (2008) 2840-2850; F.G. Mitri, Equivalence of expressions for the acoustic scattering of a progressive high order Bessel beam by an elastic sphere, IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control 56 (2009) 1100-1103] to derive the general expression for the radiation force function YJm,st(ka,beta,m){$<$}0), which is the radiation force per unit characteristic energy density and unit cross-sectional surface. The radiation force function is expressed as a generalized partial wave series involving the half-cone angle beta of the wave-number components and the order m of the HOBB. RESULTS: Numerical results for the radiation force function of a first and a second-order Bessel beam standing wave incident upon a rigid sphere immersed in non-viscous water are computed. The rigid sphere calculations for YJm,st(ka,beta,m){$<$}0), show that the force is generally directed to a pressure node when m is a positive even integer number (i.e. YJm,st(ka,beta,m){$<$}0), whereas the force is generally directed toward a pressure antinode when m is a positive odd integer number (i.e. YJm,st(ka,beta,m){$<$}0). CONCLUSION: An expression is derived for the radiation force on a rigid sphere placed along the axis of an ideal non-diffracting HOBB of acoustic standing (or stationary) waves propagating in an ideal fluid. The formulation includes results of a previous work done for a zero-order Bessel beam standing wave (m=0). The proposed theory is of particular interest essentially due to its inherent value as a canonical problem in particle manipulation using the acoustic radiation force of a HOBB standing wave on a sphere. It may also serve as the benchmark for comparison to other solutions obtained by strictly numerical or asymptotic approaches.},

This suggests that the (complex) form function presented here may be used to advantage toward studying the acoustic scattering of a HOBB by spherical shells, coated spheres, and coated spherical shells using their corresponding scattering partial wave coefficients available in standard and recent literature texts.},

Specifically, the negative force on the rigid sphere arises when the kinematic energy density is larger than the potential energy density.

A general formulation for the radiation force function, which is the radiation force per unit energy density per unit cross-sectional surface, is derived. Specialized forms of the radiation force function are provided for several types of incident waves including plane progressive, plane standing, plane quasi-standing, cylindrical progressive diverging, cylindrical progressive converging and cylindrical standing and quasi-standing diverging waves (with an extension to the case of spherical standing and quasi-standing diverging waves incident upon a sphere).

This new class of Bessel beams preserves the same nondiffracting feature of conventional high-order Bessel beams of integer order. The far-field acoustic scattering field by a rigid sphere centered on the beam axis is expressed as a partial wave series involving the real number alpha, the scattering angle relative to the beam axis theta, and the half-conical angle beta of the wave number components of the beam. Unlike the acoustic scattering properties of conventional high-order Bessel beams, the acoustic forward scattering (theta = 0 degrees) and backscattering (theta = 180 degrees) of Bessel vortex beams of fractional type alpha by a rigid sphere do not vanish unless alpha becomes an integer number. Furthermore, an expression for the net instantaneous axial force is derived for the case of progressive, stationary, and quasi-stationary waves. These results provide new insights into the acoustic scattering theory in the context of nondiffracting beams. The properties of nondiffracting Bessel vortex beams of fractional type alpha may lead to the development of an "acoustic blender" with possible applications in particle rotation, mixing, and manipulation.

  abstract = {Arbitrary electromagnetic (EM) scattering of a zero-order Bessel beam by a homogeneous water sphere in air is investigated. The radial components of the electric and magnetic scattering fields are expressed using a partial wave series involving the beam-shape coefficients, scattering coefficients of the sphere, and half-conical angle of the wavenumber components of the beam. The 3D scattering directivity plots in the far-field region are evaluated using a numerical integration procedure. It is shown here that shifting the sphere off the axis of wave propagation breaks the symmetry in the directivity patterns. Moreover, the scattering strongly depends on the half-cone angle of the beam. This investigation could provide a useful test of finite element codes for the evaluation of EM scattering and radiation forces, which are important in optical tweezers and related particle manipulation applications.}

It is shown here that shifting the sphere off the axis of wave propagation induces a dependence of the scattering on the azimuthal angle. Theoretical expressions for the incident and scattered field from a rigid immovable sphere are derived. The near- and far-field acoustic scattering fields are expressed using partial wave series involving the spherical harmonics, the scattering coefficients of the sphere, the half-conical angle of the wave number components of the beam, its order and the beam-shape coefficients. The scattering coefficients of the sphere and the 3D scattering directivity plots in the near- and far-field regions are evaluated using a numerical integration procedure. The calculations indicate that the scattering directivity patterns near the sphere and in the far-field are strongly dependent upon the position of the sphere facing the incident high-order Bessel vortex beam.},

  abstract = {In a recent report [F.G. Mitri, Z.E.A. Fellah, Ultrasonics 51 (2011) 719-724], it has been found that the instantaneous axial force (i.e. acting along the axis of wave propagation) of a Bessel acoustic beam centered on a sphere is only determined for the fundamental order (i.e. m=0) but vanishes when the beam is of vortex type (i.e. m{$>$}0, where m is the order (or helicity) of the beam). It has also been recognized that for circularly symmetric beams (such as Bessel beams of integer order), the transverse (lateral) instantaneous force should vanish as required by symmetry. Nevertheless, in this commentary, the present analysis unexpectedly reveals the existence of a transverse instantaneous force on a rigid sphere centered on the axis of a Bessel vortex beam of unit magnitude order (i.e. |m|=1) not reported in [F.G. Mitri, Z.E.A. Fellah, Ultrasonics 51 (2011) 719-724]. The presence of the transverse instantaneous force components of a first-order Bessel vortex beam results from mathematical anti-symmetry in the surface integrals, but vanishes for the fundamental (m=0) and higher-order Bessel (vortex) beams (i.e. |m|{$>$}1). Here, closed-form solutions for the instantaneous force components are obtained and examples for the transverse components for progressive waves are computed for a fixed and a movable rigid sphere. The results show that only the dipole (n=1) mode in the scattering contributes to the instantaneous force components, as well as how the transverse instantaneous force per unit cross-sectional surface varies versus the dimensionless frequency ka (k is the wave number in the fluid medium and a is the sphere's radius), and the half-cone angle beta of the beam. Moreover, the velocity of the movable sphere is evaluated based on the concept of mechanical impedance. The proposed analysis may be of interest in the analysis of transverse instantaneous forces on spherical particles for particle manipulation and rotation in drug delivery and other biomedical or industrial applications.}

  abstract = {Vibroacoustography (VA) is an ultrasound-based modality sensitive to stiffness and free from speckle and possesses some advantages over conventional ultrasound imaging in terms of image quality. The primary objective here is to show its feasibility in detecting/imaging kidney stones (KSs) in vitro . In VA, two intersecting ultrasound beams driven at two different frequencies f1 and f2, respectively, are focused within a freshly excised porcine kidney attached to a solid frame with elastic rubber bands, while the amplitude of the acoustic emission pressure field produced at the difference frequency Δf = |f1 - f2| is detected by a low-frequency hydrophone. The received low-frequency signal is bandpass filtered and amplified, then digitized by a 14-bits/sample digitizer. The data are then recorded on a computer and processed numerically to construct the images. 2-D magnitude VA images are obtained at different depths within the kidney before and after stone implantation, showing kidney features and stones shapes. Experiments conducted in a water tank on a chalk sphere as well as a series of excised kidneys in which stones are artificially embedded show that all the implanted stones are detected at all chosen depths, when compared with an X-ray fluoroscopy taken to be the reference image. The resulting VA images, obtained from a nonionizing type of radiation (i.e., ultrasound waves) as compared to fluoroscopy, are speckle free unlike conventional ultrasound images. The results presented in this preliminary feasibility study show that VA allows imaging KSs in vitro, and provide the impetus to further develop and investigate VA imaging in a clinical setting for in vivo applications.},

Phys. 109 (2011) 014916] to the generalized case of arbitrary scattering from a fluid sphere placed off-axially. The scattered pressure is expressed using a generalized partial-wave series expansion involving the beam-shape coefficients (BSCs), the scattering coefficients of the fluid sphere, and the half-conical angle of the beam. The BSCs are evaluated using the numerical discrete spherical harmonics transform (DSHT). The properties of the off-axial acoustic scattering by a fluid red blood sphere (RBS), chosen as an example to illustrate the analysis, are discussed. 3D numerical computations for the directivity patterns in the near and far-field regions reveal unexplored phenomena that may be useful in applications related to particle entrapment, manipulation or rotation of soft matter using acoustic HOBTBs. Other potential applications may include medical or nondestructive ultrasound imaging with contrast agents, or monitoring of the manufacturing processes of sample soft matter systems with HOBTBs.}

  abstract = {The generalized theory of resonance scattering (GTRS) by an elastic spherical target in acoustics is extended to describe the arbitrary scattering of a finite beam using the addition theorem for the spherical wave functions of the first kind under a translation of the coordinate origin. The advantage of the proposed method over the standard discrete spherical harmonics transform previously used in the GTRS formalism is the computation of the off-axial beam-shape coefficients (BSCs) stemming from a closed-form partial-wave series expansion representing the axial BSCs in spherical coordinates. With this general method, the arbitrary acoustical scattering can be evaluated for any particle shape and size, whether the particle is partially or completely illuminated by the incident beam. Numerical examples for the axial and off-axial resonance scattering from an elastic sphere placed arbitrarily in the field of a finite circular piston transducer with uniform vibration are provided. Moreover, the 3-D resonance directivity patterns illustrate the theory and reveal some properties of the scattering. Numerous applications involving the scattering phenomenon in imaging, particle manipulation, and the characterization of multiphase flows can benefit from the present analysis because all physically realizable beams radiate acoustical waves from finite transducers as opposed to waves of infinite extent.},

The Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral and the addition theorems for the Legendre and spherical wave functions are used to obtain the PWSEs assuming weakly focused beams (with focusing angle alpha 20 degrees ) in the Fresnel-Kirchhoff (parabolic) approximation. In contrast with previous analytical models, the derived expressions allow computing the scattering and acoustic radiation force from a sphere of radius a without restriction to either the Rayleigh (a {$<<$} lambda, where lambda is the wavelength of the incident radiation) or the ray acoustics (a {$>>$}lambda) regimes. The analytical formulations are valid for wavelengths largely exceeding the radius of the focused acoustic radiator, when the viscosity of the surrounding fluid can be neglected, and when the sphere is translated along the axis of wave propagation. Computational results illustrate the analysis with particular emphasis on the sphere's elastic properties and the axial distance to the center of the concave surface, with close connection of the emergence of negative trapping forces. Potential applications are in single-beam acoustical tweezers, acoustic levitation, and particle manipulation.},

  abstract = {Personal sound zones (PSZ) systems use an array of loudspeakers to render independent audio signals to multiple listeners within a room. The performance of a PSZ system, designed using weighted pressure matching, depends on the selected target responses for the bright zone. In reverberant environments, the target responses are generally chosen to be the room impulse responses from one of the loudspeakers to the control points in the selected bright zone. This approach synthesizes the direct propagation component and all the reverberant components in the bright zone, while minimizing the energy in the dark zone. We present a theoretical analysis to show that high energy differences cannot be achieved for the diffuse reverberant components in the bright and dark zones, and so trying to synthesize these components in the bright zone does not lead to the best performance. It is then shown that the performance can be improved by using windowed versions of these measured impulse responses as target signals, in order to control which reverberant components are synthesized in the bright zone and which are not. This observation is supported by experimental measurements in two scenarios with different levels of reverberation.},

  abstract = {Sound zones are valuable in scenarios where multiple people are present in the same room but want to listen to individual audio content without wearing headphones. The purpose of sound zone methods is to minimize the acoustic leakage between the zones by controlling multiple loudspeakers. This requires knowledge of how the loudspeakers interact with the room and radiate sound to the zones. That interaction is characterized by the transfer functions between the loudspeakers and microphones sampling the sound field in the zones. In this paper, the effect on the acoustic separation due to inherent noise in in situ transfer function measurements is investigated. The attainable separation is analyzed in the frequency range 20-300 Hz by means of the eigenfunctions of a rectangular room. The concept of observable degrees of freedom is introduced to indicate the number of active eigenfunctions, which are different within the zones at a given frequency. Likewise, controllable degrees of freedom indicate whether each source can excite the active eigenfunctions independently. It is argued that high separation can be achieved when the observable degrees of freedom are fewer than the controllable, and the target sound field can be described by the observable degrees of freedom. However, to attain this high separation it is a requirement that the details in the transfer functions associated with these degrees of freedom can be resolved in the presence of the measurement noise. For both simulated and experimental conditions the transfer functions are estimated using Bayesian inference and the uncertainty in the estimates is used to automatically regularize the sound field control. This regularization is seen to improve the performance when the measurement noise is correlated between the microphones and have little effect when the noise is uncorrelated.},

  abstract = {Wave-based analog signal processing holds the promise of extremely fast, on-the-fly, power-efficient data processing, occurring as a wave propagates through an artificially engineered medium. Yet, due to the fundamentally weak non-linearities of traditional electromagnetic materials, such analog processors have been so far largely confined to simple linear projections such as image edge detection or matrix multiplications. Complex neuromorphic computing tasks, which inherently require strong non-linearities, have so far remained out-of-reach of wave-based solutions, with a few attempts that implemented non-linearities on the digital front, or used weak and inflexible non-linear sensors, restraining the learning performance. Here, we tackle this issue by demonstrating the relevance of time-Floquet physics to induce a strong non-linear entanglement between signal inputs at different frequencies, enabling a power-efficient and versatile wave platform for analog extreme deep learning involving a single, uniformly modulated dielectric layer and a scattering medium. We prove the efficiency of the method for extreme learning machines and reservoir computing to solve a range of challenging learning tasks, from forecasting chaotic time series to the simultaneous classification of distinct datasets. Our results open the way for optical wave-based machine learning with high energy efficiency, speed and scalability.},

By developing a modal model of the acoustic environment of the enclosure the shape modes and their frequencies are obtained and on suitable bandwidth for the controller design is calculated. In order to simplify the analysis the noise sources are assumed localized and internal in one corner of the kiosk. The analysis results show that due to the existence of some degenerate modes in this application, the control action is complicated. Simulation results demonstrate how positions and number of loudspeakers and microphones will change the performance of the controller and its corresponding control effort. Based on these results and analysis a reasonable size for the controller and proper locations for sensors and actuators are proposed. Simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in reduction of the acoustic potential energy in the kiosk.},

  abstract = {Holographic methods from optics can be adapted to acoustics for enabling novel applications in particle manipulation or patterning by generating dynamic custom-tailored acoustic fields. Here, we present three contributions towards making the field of acoustic holography more widespread. Firstly, we introduce an iterative algorithm that accurately calculates the amplitudes and phases of an array of ultrasound emitters in order to create a target amplitude field in mid-air. Secondly, we use the algorithm to analyse the impact of spatial, amplitude and phase emission resolution on the resulting acoustic field, thus providing engineering insights towards array design. For example, we show an onset of diminishing returns for smaller than a quarter-wavelength sized emitters and a phase and amplitude resolution of eight and four divisions per period, respectively. Lastly, we present a hardware platform for the generation of acoustic holograms. The array is integrated in a single board composed of 256 emitters operating at 40 kHz. We hope that the results and procedures described within this paper enable researchers to build their own ultrasonic arrays and explore novel applications of ultrasonic holograms.},

  abstract = {Time reflection is a uniform inversion of the temporal evolution of a signal, which arises when an abrupt change in the properties of the host material occurs uniformly in space. At such a time interface, a portion of the input signal is time reversed, and its frequency spectrum is homogeneously translated as its momentum is conserved, forming the temporal counterpart of a spatial interface. Combinations of time interfaces, forming time metamaterials and Floquet matter, exploit the interference of multiple time reflections for extreme wave manipulation, leveraging time as an additional degree of freedom. Here we report the observation of photonic time reflection and associated broadband frequency translation in a switched transmission-line metamaterial whose effective capacitance is homogeneously and abruptly changed via a synchronized array of switches. A pair of temporal interfaces are combined to demonstrate time-reflection-induced wave interference, realizing the temporal counterpart of a Fabry–Pérot cavity. Our results establish the foundational building blocks to realize time metamaterials and Floquet photonic crystals, with opportunities for extreme photon manipulation in space and time.},

(doi:10.1016/0165-2125(81)90008-1)) and are now known as elastic materials of the Willis type, or simply Willis materials. As coupling between these two constitutive equations is a generalization of standard elastodynamic theory, restrictions on the physically admissible material properties for Willis materials should be similarly generalized. This paper derives restrictions imposed on the material properties of Willis materials when they are assumed to be reciprocal, passive and causal. Considerations of causality and low-order dispersion suggest an alternative formulation of the standard Willis equations. The alternative formulation provides improved insight into the subwavelength physical behaviour leading to Willis material properties and is amenable to time-domain analyses. Finally, the results initially obtained for a generally elastic material are specialized to the acoustic limit.},

This response is analogous to bianisotropy in electromagnetism, is absent from common materials, and is often referred to as Willis coupling after J.R., Willis, who first described it in the context of the dynamic response of heterogeneous elastic media. This work presents two principal results: first, experimental and theoretical demonstrations, illustrating that Willis properties are required to obtain physically meaningful effective material properties resulting solely from local behaviour of an asymmetric one-dimensional isolated element and, second, an experimental procedure to extract the effective material properties from a one-dimensional isolated element. The measured material properties are in very good agreement with theoretical predictions and thus provide improved understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to Willis coupling in acoustic metamaterials.},

First, a perturbation method is used to describe the influence of Willis coupling on the scattered field to a first-order approximation. A higher order analysis of the scattering based on generalized impedances is then derived. Finally, a finite-element method-based numerical scheme for calculating the scattered field is presented. These three analyses are compared and show strong agreement for low to moderate levels of Willis coupling.},

Spot audio techniques have been explored by generating the ultrasound beams toward the target person in certain area however everyone in this area can hear the sound. Our system recognizes the positions of each person indoor using motion capture and 3D model data of the room. After that we control direction of parametric speaker in real-time so that sound reach only particular person by calculating the reflection of sound on surfaces such as wall and ceiling. We calculate direction of parametric speaker using a beam tracing method. We present generating methods of dynamic acoustic field in our system and conducted the experiments on human factor to evaluate performance of proposed system.},

  abstract = {This paper considers source excitation strategies in finite difference time domain room acoustics simulations for auralization purposes. We demonstrate that FDTD simulations can be conducted to obtain impulse responses based on unit impulse excitation, this being the shortest, simplest and most efficiently implemented signal that might be applied. Single, rather than double, precision accuracy simulations might be implemented where memory use is critical but the consequence is a remarkably increased noise floor. Hard source excitation introduces a discontinuity in the simulated acoustic field resulting in a shift of resonant modes from expected values. Additive sources do not introduce such discontinuities, but instead result in a broadband offset across the frequency spectrum. Transparent sources address both of these issues and with unit impulse excitation the calculation of the compensation filters required to implement transparency is also simplified. However, both transparent and additive source excitation demonstrate solution growth problems for a bounded space. Any of these approaches might be used if the consequences are understood and compensated for, however, for room acoustics simulation the hard source is the least favorable due to the fundamental changes it imparts on the underlying geometry. These methods are further tested through the implementation of a directional sound source based on multiple omnidirectional point sources.},

Conjugate symmetric beamforming weights are used so that the upper and non-convex lower bound constraints on the beampattern can be convex. Thus, a mainlobe of an arbitrary beamwidth and response ripple can be obtained. This method can achieve completely arbitrary sidelobe levels. By minimizing a re-weighted objective function based on the magnitudes of the elements in the beamforming weight vector iteratively, the proposed method selects certain antennas in an array to satisfy the prescribed beampattern specifications precisely. Interestingly, a sparse array with fewer antennas (compared to other methods) is produced. This method can design non-uniformly spaced arrays with inter-element spacings larger than one half-wavelength, without the appearance of grating lobes in the resulting beampattern. Simulations are shown using arrays of up to a few hundred antennas to illustrate the practicality of the proposed method.},

In the presence of large steering vector mismatches, the uncertainty set has to expand to accommodate the increased error. This degrades the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of these beamformers since their interference-plus-noise suppression abilities are weakened. In this paper, an iterative robust minimum variance beamformer (IRMVB) is proposed which uses a small uncertainty sphere (and a small flat ellipsoid) to search for the desired array steering vector iteratively. This preserves the interference-plus-noise suppression ability of the proposed beamformer and results in a higher output SINR. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.},

When the walls have finite impedances, the acoustic eigenvalue equation becomes complicated and a numerical method that can find all roots within a given interval is required to solve it. In this study, the interval Newton∕generalized bisection (IN∕GB) method is adopted for solving this problem. For an efficient implementation of this method, bounds are derived for the acoustic eigenvalues and their asymptotic behavior explored. The accuracy of the IN∕GB method is verified for a canonical problem by comparing the modal solution with the corresponding finite element solution. Furthermore, reverberation times estimated using the IN∕GB method are compared to those calculated using the finite difference method. Through these examples, it is demonstrated that the IN∕GB method provides a useful and efficient approach for estimating the acoustic responses of rectangular rooms with finite wall impedances.},

We have already proposed the portable parametric array loudspeaker which can realize personal audio without using earphones and headphones. In this system, parametric array loudspeakers are mounted on two edges of tablet PCs and can radiate highly directional stereo sound to the user. However, the radiated sound beams may not focus on the user's ears when the user's head is moving. In this paper, we examine the phased array technique to steer the sound beam based on the user's head position. We demonstrate that the sound beam angle can be appropriately steered by using the phased array technique through experimental results.},

Three types of non-redundant samplings, random, hybrid (perturbed deterministic) and deterministic (spiral) are shown to provide completeness of the resulting sampled Zernike polynomial expansion. When completeness is guaranteed, then we can obtain an orthonormal basis, and hence the inversion only requires transposition of the matrix formed by the basis vectors (modes). The discrete Zernike modes are given for different sampling patterns and number of samples. The DZT has been implemented showing better performance, numerical stability and robustness than the standard Zernike expansion in numerical simulations. Non-redundant (critical) sampling along with an invertible transformation can be useful in a wide variety of applications.},

The total time averaged acoustic potential energy is expressed as a quadratic function of the complex strengths of a number of secondary sources of sound introduced into the enclosure. For a given number and location of secondary sources, there is a unique set of source strengths which determines the minimum value of this function. The analysis is applied to the case of a lightly damped enclosure excited by a point primary source at a frequency above the Schroeder cut-off frequency. It is demonstrated that substantial reductions in the total time averaged acoustic potential energy are possible only if the secondary sources of sound are located at a distance from the primary source which is less than half a wavelength at the frequency of interest.},

This technique involves the determination of the invariant of the time-reversal operator obtained by measurement of the scattering data in a pulse-echo mode. In this paper, a proposed approach based on the DORT method is developed to solve the acoustic inverse scattering problem of a small metallic scatterer. The proposed approach not only estimates the position of the scatterer, but also determines the physical properties of an unknown metallic scatterer such as the shape (cylinder or sphere), the material (density), and the size (radius) in an anisotropic scattering case. Theoretical and numerical simulation results are also studied and investigated to show that the proposed approach can simultaneously characterize all those properties of an unknown metallic scatterer. Moreover, the advantage of the proposed approach is to avoid the complex iterative scheme in solving the direct scattering problem and results in smaller computational load and faster implementation.}

  abstract = {Many signal processing-based methods for sound source direction-of-arrival estimation produce a spatial pseudo-spectrum of which the local maxima strongly indicate the source directions. Due to different levels of noise, reverberation and different number of overlapping sources, the spatial pseudo-spectra are noisy even after smoothing. In addition, the number of sources is often unknown. As a result, selecting the peaks from these spectra is susceptible to error. Convolutional neural network has been successfully applied to many image processing problems in general and direction-of-arrival estimation in particular. In addition, deep learning-based methods for direction-of-arrival estimation show good generalization to different environments. We propose to use a 2D convolutional neural network with multi-task learning to robustly estimate the number of sources and the directions-of-arrival from short-time spatial pseudo-spectra, which have useful directional information from audio input signals. This approach reduces the tendency of the neural network to learn unwanted association between sound classes and directional information, and helps the network generalize to unseen sound classes. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform other directional-of-arrival estimation methods in different levels of noise and reverberation, and different number of sources.},

  abstract = {In general, one of the dual boundary integral equations (BIE) is always a kind of derivative BIE with the hypersingular integral. The treatment of the hyper-singularities is difficult in the boundary element methods (BEM). This paper focuses on the BIE in the two-dimensional potential problems. A series of transformations are manipulated on the conventional potential derivative BIE in order to eliminate the hyper-singularity. It leads to a new natural BIE in the two-dimensional potential problems. The natural BIE also belongs to the derivative BIE, but only contains the strongly singular integral. The evaluation for the strongly singular integral is given by the subtraction method. As a result, another boundary element analysis according to the natural BIE can obtain more accurate potential derivatives on the boundary in comparison with the conventional BEM. Furthermore, the natural BIE can also be applied to calculating the potential derivatives at the interior points very close to the boundary. Some comparisons with exact solutions are done to illustrate the application and efficiency of the natural BIE.},

  abstract = {A label-free approach to improving the performances of confocal scanning imaging is proposed. We experimentally demonstrate its feasibility using acoustic waves. It relies on a way to encode spatial information using the temporal dimension. By moving an emitter, used to insonify an object, along a circular path, we create a temporally modulated wavefield. Because of the symmetries of the problem, the spatiotemporal input field can be decomposed into harmonics corresponding to different spatial vortices. Acquiring the back-reflected waves with receivers that are also rotating, multiple images of the same object with different point spread functions are obtained. Not only is the resolution improved compared to a standard confocal configuration, but the accumulation of information also allows the building of images that beat the diffraction limit.},

  abstract = {This study proposes an experimental method for evaluating isotropy in enclosures, based on an analysis of the wavenumber spectrum in the spherical harmonics domain. The wavenumber spectrum, which results from expanding an arbitrary sound field into a plane-wave basis, is used to characterize the spatial properties of the observed sound field. Subsequently, the obtained wavenumber spectrum is expanded into a series of spherical harmonics, and the moments from this spherical expansion are used to characterize the isotropy of the wave field. The analytical framework is presented. The method is examined numerically and experimentally, based on array measurements in four chambers: two anechoic chambers (one with a single source and another with an array of 52 sources), a reverberation chamber, and the same reverberation chamber with a sample of absorbing material on the floor. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is suitable for assessing the isotropy of a sound field.},

Spatio-temporal measurements of the sound field are obtained, and a wavenumber decomposition is performed as a function of time, which serves to examine the directional properties of the sound field and its angular symmetry. Experimental results are obtained in a reverberation room in four different configurations (the empty room, with an absorber on the floor, with panel diffusers, and without them). The results demonstrate how isotropy tends to increase or decrease as a function of time, depending on the disposition of the diffusing and absorbing elements. Diffusers are found to effectively redirect the energy in the room, although they do not succeed in generating a uniform incidence on the sample. The proposed approach makes it possible to analyze the specific processes occurring in a reverberation chamber and can provide valuable insights in the process of standardization to verify the directional properties found in each reverberation room.},

Microphones with different sensitivities placed at incidence angles of 0° and 90° were used to measure demodulation frequency components without special acoustic filters. The measured components were compared with theoretical predictions. The results show that the measured sound pressure using microphones placed at 0° was up to several tens of decibels larger than the theoretical predictions and significantly inaccurate in the near field. This was due to the nonlinear response of the microphone, which had high sensitivity at primary sound frequencies, inducing spurious signals. This result suggests that using a microphone with low sensitivity at primary sound frequencies placed at an appropriate angle that reduces sensitivity improves parametric sound measurement accuracy.},

The formulation demonstrates that the Willis equations of elastodynamics are closed under homogenization. The effective material parameters are obtained for arbitrary frequency and wavenumber combinations, including but not restricted to Bloch wave branches for wave propagation in the periodic medium. Numerical examples for a one-dimensional system illustrate the frequency dependence of the parameters on Bloch wave branches and provide a comparison with an alternative dynamic effective medium theory, which also reduces to Willis form but with different effective moduli.},

  abstract = {Content based 3D shape retrieval for broad domains like the World Wide Web has recently gained considerable attention in Computer Graphics community. One of the main challenges in this context is the mapping of 3D objects into compact canonical representations referred to as descriptors, which serve as search keys during the retrieval process. The descriptors should have certain desirable properties like invariance under scaling, rotation and translation. Very importantly, they should possess descriptive power providing a basis for similarity measure between three-dimensional objects which is close to the human notion of resemblance.In this paper we advocate the usage of so-called 3D Zernike invariants as descriptors for content based 3D shape retrieval. The basis polynomials of this representation facilitate computation of invariants under the above transformations. Some theoretical results have already been summarized in the past from the aspect of pattern recognition and shape analysis. We provide practical analysis of these invariants along with algorithms and computational details. Furthermore, we give a detailed discussion on influence of the algorithm parameters like type and resolution of the conversion into a volumetric function, number of utilized coefficients, etc. As is revealed by our study, the 3D Zernike descriptors are natural extensions of spherical harmonics based descriptors, which are reported to be among the most successful representations at present. We conduct a comparison of 3D Zernike descriptors against these regarding computational aspects and shape retrieval performance.},

Conceptually, the cylindrical angular spectrum can be understood as a cylindrical version of the omnidirectional spectral approach of Sando et al. Our Fourier coefficient formula is based on an intuitive observation that a point light radiates uniformly in all directions. Our formula is defined over all frequency vectors lying on the entire sphere in the 3D Fourier space and is more natural and computationally more efficient for all around recording of the object wave than that of the previous omnidirectional spectral method. A generalized frequency-based occlusion culling method for an arbitrary complex object is also proposed to enhance the 3D quality of a hologram. As a practical application of the cylindrical angular spectrum, an interactive hologram example is presented together with implementation details.},

To describe the effectiveness of the proposal in actual environments, this paper investigates the experimental validation of the proposed approach with rectangular and Hann windows and compared it with three conventional methods: simple delay-and-sum beamforming, contrast maximization, and least squares-based pressure matching using an actually implemented linear array of 64 loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber. The results of both the computer simulations and the actual experiments show that the proposed approach with a Hann window more accurately controlled the bright and dark zones than the conventional methods.},

The arrays emitted sound with different ultrasonic frequencies from each side, and an audible sound with a differential frequency is generated between input ultrasonic signals. In particular, we designed and created a new array that can control the number of transducers driven in the array. We evaluated the frequency–amplitude characteristics and directivity when the transducers in the array were driven in an annular shape. There is an optimum array shape and number of transducers that can be driven for a specific distance between arrays.},

By setting the weights for the sideband signals in the single side-band (SSB) modulation to the optimum values, the directivity of the audible sound can be controlled to be ideal. The sum of squares of the difference between the directivity of the reproduced audible sound and the ideal directivity is used as an evaluation function for weight design, and the weights are updated to minimize the evaluation function by the quasi-Newton method. Through the numerical analysis of the sound pressure distribution of PAL beam control using the weights designed by the proposed method, it is demonstrated that the grating lobes are suppressed and the acoustic beam is formed to the desired direction compared with the case using the weights designed by the conventional Chebyshev function.},

  abstract = {Green’s functions for acoustic problems is the fundamental solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation for a point source, which satisfies specific boundary conditions. It is very significant for the integral equation and also serves as the impulse response of an acoustic wave equation. They are important for acoustic problems that involve the propagation of sound from the source point to the observer position. Once the Green’s function, which satisfies the necessary boundary conditions, is obtained, the sound pressure at any point away from the source can be easily calculated by the integral equation. The major problem faced by researchers is in the process of constructing these Green’s functions which satisfy a specific boundary condition. The aim of this work is to review some of these fundamental solutions available in the literature for different boundary conditions for the ease of analyzing acoustics problems. The review covers the free-space Green’s functions for stationary source and rotational source, for both when the observer and the acoustic medium are at rest and when the medium is in uniform flow. The half-space Green’s functions are also summarized for both stationary acoustic source and moving acoustic source, derived using the image source method, equivalent source method and complex equivalent method in both time domain and frequency domain. Each of these methods used depends on the different impedance boundary conditions for which the Green’s function will satisfy. Finally, enclosed spaced Green’s functions for both rectangular duct and cylindrical duct for an infinite and finite duct is also covered in the review.},

Although the angular spectrum is equally applicable to fields far from the transducer, the efficient calculation is derived specifically for fields in or very close to the source plane. An antialiasing algorithm is proposed that allows the source to be discretized with fewer sample points for a given accuracy than required with simple discretization techniques. Guidelines for the selection of sampling interval, discretization size, etc. are developed on an application-specific basis and indicate the best ratio of numerical accuracy to computational cost.{$<>$}},

The implemented ASM code is validated against custom Rayleigh integral code in a pure propagation simulation. In addition, ultrasound beam reflection calculations using ASM with finite element numerical results and experimental measurements are compared, finding good agreement in both cases. Then, ASM is used to estimate the sensitivity of specular reflection signals to variations in the composition of the incidence medium as a function of the angle of incidence.

  abstract = {This presentation is concerned with the “Russian part” of the history of parametric arrays (PAs) started from the pioneering works of P. Westervelt in USA. In the Soviet Union, V. Zverev and A. Kalachev have suggested the PA almost simultaneously but the work remained classified. After a decade of relative isolation, Soviet researches became involved internationally in the work on the PAs and, more generally, of nonlinear acoustic beams. Several Russian institutions have been involved, including Moscow University, Andreev Institute of Acoustics in Moscow, Radiophysics Research Institute and Institute of Applied Physics in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Gorky University, Pacific Oceanographic Institute in Vladivostok, and some others. Selected the Russian contributions of different years are to be outlined in this talk, including: •The theory of nonlinear acoustic beams, e.g., the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya- Kuznetsov equation and other models of nonlinear acoustic beams in application to the PA. •The limitation of the PA efficiency by shock wave formation; •Possible enhancement of the PA radiation by bubble “curtains”; •Experiments in laboratory and in the ocean; •Some new developments such as generation of low-frequency shear waves by ultrasound beams with biophysical applications.},

  abstract = {We report theoretically on sub-wavelength acoustic energy harvesting (AEH) using a thin acoustic metamaterial (AM) made of spring-mass resonators attached to the surface of a homogeneous elastic thin plate. Considering an incident acoustic wave hitting the AM plate, tunable and highly efficient AEH is achieved by introducing a sub-wavelength defect inside the AM structure to confine the elastic energy into a spot which is then electromechanically converted into electrical power using a ceramic PZT patch. Several types of sub-wavelength cavities capable of confining acoustic energy at the sonic regime are extensively investigated for the optimization of AEH. Three analytical approaches—band structure, sound transmission loss and electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion—are proposed to fully describe the system interaction with the acoustic wave and quantify the AEH performance. The computed results show that an average power of 18 μW can be harvested using a specific cavity design of only size from an incident acoustic wave with a sound pressure level of 100 dB at 520 Hz. Such a system can open up a way through the design of effective tunable sub-wavelength acoustic energy harvesters based on AM applied to scavenge energy from sound.},

In this paper, we introduce a one-dimensional space-time phononic crystal and study the associated anomalous topological edge states when the phononic crystal's density is modulated both in space and time. While preserving the key topological feature of the system, the time modulation also duplicates the edge state mode across the spectrum, both inside and outside the band gap. It is shown that, in contrast to conventional topological edge states which are excited by frequencies in the Bragg regime, the time-modulation-induced frequency conversion can be leveraged to access topological edge states at a deep subwavelength scale where the entire phononic crystal size can be as small as 1/5.1 of the wavelength. This feature could open another route for designing miniature devices that are based on topological physics.},

This Letter seeks to investigate the elastodynamic behavior of octet truss lattices as an important type of architected metamaterials for high effective strength and vibration shielding. We design, fabricate, and experimentally characterize three types of octet truss structures, including two homogenous structures with either thin or thick struts and one hybrid structure with alternating strut thickness. High elastic wave transmission rate is observed for the lattice with thick struts, while strong vibration mitigation is captured from the homogenous octet truss structure with thin struts as well as the hybrid octet truss lattice, though the underlying mechanisms for attenuation are fundamentally different (viscoelasticity induced dampening vs bandgaps). Compressional tests are also conducted to evaluate the effective stiffness of the three lattices. This study could open an avenue toward multifunctional architected metamaterials for vibration shielding with high mechanical strength.},

It is shown that a time-dependent but transversally homogeneous slab can be used to make a perfect image of an object in the far-field, since all the evanescent modes couple to propagative time-diffracted orders. It is found that, if the image to be obtained is axially symmetric, it can be recovered by measuring the time signal at a single point, without the need to perform a spatial scan, so that time gratings can act as well as single-pixel imaging devices. In the case of having an object without axial symmetry, the time grating can be combined with a spatial grating, and then the full image can be recovered again with a measurement at a single point. We apply the theory of compressive sensing to optimize the recovery method, and numerical examples are provided. We show, therefore, that time-modulated gratings can be used to perfectly recover the image of an object in the far-field and after measuring at a single point in space, making them a promising approach to superresolution and ultrafast imaging.},

One crucial issue is that, for a given beam size at the transmitter, the beam divergence angle increases with increasing OAM. Therefore the larger the value of OAM, the larger the aperture required at the receiving optical system if the efficiency of detection is to be maintained. Confusion exists as to whether this divergence scales linearly with, or with the square root of, the beam’s OAM. We clarify how both these scaling laws are valid, depending upon whether it is the radius of the waist of the beam’s Gaussian term or the radius of rms intensity of the beam that is kept constant while varying the OAM.},

The realization that every photon in a laser beam could carry an orbital angular momentum that was in excess of the angular momentum associated with photon spin has led both to new understandings of optical effects and various applications. These applications range from optical manipulation, imaging and quantum optics, to optical communications.

  abstract = {The real-time generation of 3-D acoustic images by an active system deploying a planar array of transducers is difficult to implement because of the hardware cost and the associated computational burden. Recently, an exact method based on chirp zeta transform (CZT) beamforming has been proposed to dramatically reduce the computational burden of 3-D wideband imaging in the near- and far-field regions. However, the computational advantage of such a method decreases if the array is thinned. In this paper, the performance of CZT beamforming applied to sparse planar arrays is investigated and compared with those of other beamforming techniques. To address the sparse array challenge, a processing technique, called pruned CZT beamforming, is proposed, which exhibits a computational burden lower than that of the previous CZT beamforming technique while providing a significant advantage over the direct implementation of the frequency-domain beamforming and is applicable when the planar array is radically thinned.},

However, it is demonstrated in this paper that this analysis fails in predicting the sound intensity distributions in the enclosures. This is due to the boundary damping approximation involved in this analysis, which has a misleading effect upon the sound absorption material locations. To illustrate this point, the sound intensity in a one‐dimensional pipe is calculated by modal analysis and the result is compared with the exact solution.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the prediction of acoustic response in a well damped rectangular enclosure. The acoustic characteristics of the enclosure are modelled using the modal expansion approach, with suitable modification of the damping and frequency shift introduced into the rigid wall acoustic modes of the enclosure. The prediction of acoustical transfer impedance in the enclosure has demonstrated that a frequency dependent modal parameter may be used to describe the acoustic response. This modal parameter is defined as the specific acoustical modal admittance, which describes the contribution of all the boundaries (locally and modally reactive and air leakage) to the modal damping and the shift of nature frequencies. The sound absorption properties of each boundary type and its effect on the response of the enclosure are analysed. The predicted and measured space-average acoustic transfer impedances in a damped rectangular enclosure are compared and reasonable agreement is found. The Helmholtz resonance effect of the cockpit in a helicopter is also included in the model. The measured dip at about 23 Hz in the space-average acoustic impedance inside the passenger cabin of the helicopter is accurately predicted.},

Commonly a dodecahedron speaker is used but due to various factors (e.g., high cost, transportation difficulties) other acoustic sources are sometimes preferred. In this review, fifteen acoustic source alternatives to a dodecahedron speaker are presented while emphasis is placed on features such as omnidirectionality, repeatability, adequate sound pressure levels, even frequency response, accuracy in measurement of acoustic parameters and fulfillment of ISO 3382-1 source requirements. Some of the alternative acoustic sources have the appropriate features to provide usable results for acoustic measurements, some have acoustic characteristics better than a dodecahedron speaker (e.g., omnidirectionality in the high-frequency range), while some can potentially fulfill the ISO 3382-1 source requirements. Collected data from this review can be used in many areas (e.g., ISO measurements, head-related transfer functions measurements) for the appropriate selection of an acoustic source according to the expected use. Finally, suggestions for uses and future work are given aimed at achieving further advances in this field.},

A remarkable new feature in this phase diagram is the coexistence of both body-centered cubic (bcc) and hexagonally close-packed (hcp) sphere phases, in a region between close-packed spheres (cps) and hexagonally packed cylinders (hex) over the concentration range phi approximately 0.33-0.45. By focusing on the transitions among these various ordered phases during heating and cooling cycles, we observed a strong hysteresis: supercooled cylinders persisted upon cooling. The stability of these supercooled cylinders is quite dependent on concentration, and for phi {$>$} or = 0.40, the supercooled cylinders do not revert to spheres even after quiescent annealing for 1 month. The spontaneous formation of spheres due to the dissociation of cylinders is kinetically hindered in this case, and the system is apparently not amenable to any pretransitional fluctuations of cylinders prior to the cylinder-to-sphere transition. This contrasts with the case of cylinders transforming to spheres upon heating in the melt. The application of large amplitude shear to the supercooled cylinders is effective in restoring the equilibrium sphere phases.}

Solutions to this problem have been presented for specific sensor configurations often requiring a larger number of sensors. However, in practical applications, the number and location of sensors are often restricted. This paper proposes to find an optimal linear basis transformation that decouples the frequency response from the spatial response. A least-squares optimal basis transform can be computed numerically for arbitrary sensor configurations, for which typically no exact analytical solutions are available. This transform can be further combined with a spherical harmonics basis resulting in readily steerable broadband beams. This solution to broadband beamforming effectively decouples the array geometry from the steering geometry. Furthermore, for frequency-invariant beams, this approach results in a significant reduction in the number of beam-design parameters. Here, the method is demonstrated for an optimal design of far-field response for an irregular linear array with as few as three sensors.},

Such an electroacoustic device consists of several transducers mounted on a sphere-like structure, which are driven independently in order to achieve non-uniform directivity patterns. The control strategy usually adopted is to provide the array with some preprogrammed basic directivities corresponding to spherical harmonic functions. Thus, an arbitrary radiation pattern can be approximately achieved by changing the gains associated with these basic directivities. Here, a different approach based on the acoustic radiation modes of the array is proposed. Unlike spherical harmonics, radiation modes constitute a finite set of vectors that spans a subspace on which any radiation pattern the array is able to reproduce can be projected. Furthermore, radiation modes radiate sound energy independently. Since the eigenvalue analysis that must be carried out in order to obtain the modes leads also to their radiation efficiencies, the low frequency constraint in the directivity synthesis by a spherical array is naturally evaluated. Finally, it is useless to drive inefficient radiation modes. Therefore, the radiation mode approach leads to a reduced number of active channels, and to minimum source voltages for a given target directivity pattern.},

Prototypes of compact spherical loudspeaker arrays have been recently developed and applied in room acoustics measurements, electroacoustic music performance and synthesis of directivity patterns of acoustical sources such as musical instruments. However, many aspects concerning their control, design, electromechanical behavior and ability to provide a more realistic sound experience than conventional audio systems remain unclear. This work concerns the analysis and synthesis of sound fields by a compact spherical loudspeaker array and aims to contribute to clarifying some aspects mentioned above. A control strategy based on the acoustic radiation modes of the spherical array is proposed, which presents several advantages over the usual strategy based on the spherical harmonics. A theoretical and experimental analysis of the electromechanical behavior of compact loudspeaker arrays is also presented, in which the acoustic coupling between drivers inside the array frame is taken into account. In addition, optimum driver signals corresponding to a given target directivity pattern are derived using two different cost functions, indicating that the realism of the synthesized pattern may be significantly increased by neglecting the phase of the target directivity pattern. Finally, the proposed theoretical models are validated through measurements of electrical impedance, loudspeaker diaphragm velocity and directivity patterns.},

  abstract = {Exterior spherical acoustical holophony is a branch of spatial audio reproduction that deals with the rendering of a given free-field radiation pattern (the primary field) by using a compact spherical loudspeaker array (the secondary source). More precisely, the primary field is known on a spherical surface surrounding the primary and secondary sources and, since the acoustic fields are described in spherical coordinates, they are naturally subjected to spherical harmonic analysis. Besides, the inverse problem of deriving optimal driving signals from a known primary field is ill-posed because the secondary source cannot radiate high-order spherical harmonics efficiently, especially in the low-frequency range. As a consequence, a standard least-squares solution will overload the transducers if the primary field contains such harmonics. Here, this is avoided by discarding the strongly decaying spherical waves, which are identified through inspection of the radiation efficiency curves of the secondary source. However, such an unavoidable regularization procedure increases the least-squares error, which also depends on the position of the secondary source. This paper deals with the above-mentioned questions in the context of far-field directivity reproduction at low and medium frequencies. In particular, an optimal secondary source position is sought, which leads to the lowest reproduction error in the least-squares sense without overloading the transducers. In order to address this issue, a regularization quality factor is introduced to evaluate the amount of regularization required. It is shown that the optimal position improves significantly the holophonic reconstruction and maximizes the regularization quality factor (minimizes the amount of regularization), which is the main general contribution of this paper. Therefore, this factor can also be used as a cost function to obtain the optimal secondary source position.},

  abstract = {Omnidirectional sound sources are widely used in room acoustics. These devices are made up of loudspeakers mounted on a spherical or polyhedral cabinet, where the dodecahedral shape prevails. Although such electroacoustic sources have been made readily available to acousticians by many manufacturers, an in-depth investigation of their vibroacoustic behavior has not been provided yet. In order to fulfill this lack, this paper presents a theoretical study of the sound radiation from omnidirectional loudspeaker arrays, which is carried out by using a mathematical model based on the spherical harmonic analysis. Eight different loudspeaker arrangements on the sphere are considered: the well-known five Platonic solid layouts and three extremal system layouts. The latter possess useful properties for spherical loudspeaker arrays used as directivity controlled sound sources, so that these layouts are included here in order to investigate whether or not they could be of interest as omnidirectional sources as well. It is shown through a comparative analysis that the dodecahedral array leads to the lowest error in producing an omnidirectional sound field and to the highest acoustic power, which corroborates the prevalence of such a layout. In addition, if a source with less than 12 loudspeakers is required, it is shown that tetrahedra or hexahedra can be used alternatively, whereas the extremal system layouts are not interesting choices for omnidirectional loudspeaker arrays.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, compact spherical loudspeaker arrays have emerged as directivity controlled electroacoustic sources. The usual approach to control such a device is to provide it with a finite set of pre-programmed directivities corresponding to spherical harmonics or to the acoustic radiation modes (ARMs) of the array. However, these orthogonal bases are not suited for the acoustic control in the near field, which requires a number of spherical harmonics larger than the number of loudspeakers, and modes that take into account the reactive part of the complex sound power, not only the active part as is the case for the conventional ARMs. This paper presents a theoretical and numerical study of alternative ARM approaches applied to spherical loudspeaker arrays that consider both components of the sound power, with focus on the arrangements following the regularity of the five Platonic solids. For such arrays, it is shown that the active, reactive, and the so-called generalized ARMs form exactly the same basis, which does not depend either on frequency, source-receptor distance or on the vibration pattern and shape of the individual loudspeakers, provided that these are identical and axisymmetric. Closed-form expressions for the modal active and reactive efficiencies are derived and evaluated for the Platonic solid loudspeakers as a function of frequency and source-receptor distance. In addition, an application example in local active noise control is presented, in which a spherical loudspeaker array is used as a secondary source aiming at producing a zone of quiet in its near field.},

  abstract = {Time reversal (TR) signal processing is an effective tool to exploit a reverberant environment for the intentional focusing of airborne, audible sound. A previous room acoustics TR study found preliminary evidence that above a certain focal amplitude the focal waveform begins to display signs of nonlinearity [Willardson, Anderson, Young, Denison, and Patchett, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 143(2), 696–705 (2018)]. This study investigates that nonlinearity further by increasing the focal peak amplitudes beyond that previously observed. This increases the nonlinear characteristics, allowing for a closer inspection of their properties. An experiment is conducted using eight horn loudspeaker sources and a single receiver in a reverberation chamber. A maximum peak focal amplitude of 214.8\,kPa (200.6\,dBpk) is achieved. The focus signal waveforms are linearly scaled to observe and characterize the nonlinear amplification of the waveform. Frequency spectra of the peak focal amplitudes are plotted to observe changes in frequency content as the signals become nonlinear. A one-dimensional spatial scan of the focal region is conducted to observe properties of the converging and diverging waves. A proposal for a possible explanation involving free-space Mach stem formation is given.},

We demonstrate, by means of a full three-dimensional numerical analysis and a thorough experimental study, that the acoustic force, and thus the particle’s behavior, critically depends on its size. While particles within certain size ranges, including those smaller than half the wavelength, are trapped on axis around the pressure nodes, particles in other size ranges are trapped off axis nearby the pressure antinodes. This behavior, related with sign inversions of the radiation force, implies that the magnitude of the force, and thus the trapping stiffness, can be maximum or null for some specific sizes. As a case of study, we analyze expanded polystyrene particles levitated in air with an ultrasonic frequency of 40 kHz, a relevant system due to recent applications for the development of volumetric displays. Yet, our results illustrate a general behavior of radiation-based traps with structured wave fields.},

Alongside conventional ducted turbofan designs, new open-rotor contra-rotating power plants are currently under development, which present their own noise challenges. The key sources of tonal and broadband noise, and the way in which noise propagates away from the source, are surveyed in both cases. We also consider in detail two key aspects underpinning the flow physics that continue to receive considerable attention, namely the acoustics of swirling flow and unsteady flow-blade interactions.

Here we report PT-symmetry breaking in coupled optical resonators. We observed non-reciprocity in the PT-symmetry-breaking phase due to strong field localization, which significantly enhances nonlinearity. In the linear regime, light transmission is reciprocal regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or unbroken. We show that in one direction there is a complete absence of resonance peaks whereas in the other direction the transmission is resonantly enhanced, a feature directly associated with the use of resonant structures.

  abstract = {Optical systems combining balanced loss and gain provide a unique platform to implement classical analogues of quantum systems described by non-Hermitian parity–time (PT)-symmetric Hamiltonians. Such systems can be used to create synthetic materials with properties that cannot be attained in materials having only loss or only gain. Here we report PT-symmetry breaking in coupled optical resonators. We observed non-reciprocity in the PT-symmetry-breaking phase due to strong field localization, which significantly enhances nonlinearity. In the linear regime, light transmission is reciprocal regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or unbroken. We show that in one direction there is a complete absence of resonance peaks whereas in the other direction the transmission is resonantly enhanced, a feature directly associated with the use of resonant structures. Our results could lead to a new generation of synthetic optical systems enabling on-chip manipulation and control of light propagation.},

Willis coupling can provide a new degree of freedom to control sound propagation, which has been enabling several novel applications. In this work, based on the general constitutive relations of Willis media and the acoustic Poynting theorem, we study the constraints stemming from fundamental symmetries – parity, time-reversal, reciprocity and energy conservation – in these media. The wave features, such as wave-vectors, wave impedance and orthogonality are also generally investigated. In addition, we put forward a nonlocal model that unveils the relation between Willis media and nonlocal materials, and how Willis phenomena stem from weak forms of nonlocality.},

However, the correlation coefficient needs to be obtained by measuring the complex-valued S-parameters in an RC, which is no longer applicable to active antenna tests where the phase information is unavailable. To solve this problem, we propose an antenna radiation pattern reconstruction method based on phaseless measurement in an RC. In this method, the power correlation coefficient of AUT is calculated using the signal amplitude received by the antenna at different angles. According to the relationship between complex correlation coefficient and power correlation coefficient of the AUT, the nonlinear least squares method is used to reverse the spherical wave coefficients and reconstruct the antenna radiation pattern. Simulations and measurements are carried out in RC and anechoic chamber, which demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method.},

These geometries would be useful for modeling lymph nodes, tumors, blood vessels, capillaries, bones, the head, and other body parts. Mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC) has also been used to compare the results from the MCML with embedded objects (MCML-EO). Our simulation assumes a realistic tissue model and can also handle the transmission/reflection at the object-tissue boundary due to the mismatch of the refractive index. Simulation of MCML-EO takes a few seconds, whereas MMC takes nearly an hour for the same geometry and optical properties. Contour plots of fluence distribution from MCML-EO and MMC correlate well. This study assists one to decide on the tool to use for modeling light propagation in biological tissue with objects of regular shapes embedded in it. For irregular inhomogeneity in the model (tissue), MMC has to be used. If the embedded objects (inhomogeneity) are of regular geometry (shapes), then MCML-EO is a better option, as simulations like Raman scattering, fluorescent imaging, and optical coherence tomography are currently possible only with MCML.},

It regulates complement activation by proteolytic degradation of C3b or C4b in the presence of factor H, complement receptor type 1, membrane cofactor protein or C4b-binding protein as cofactor. It is constructed from five presumed independently folded domains, namely a factor I module, a CD5-like domain, two low-density-lipoprotein receptor type A domains and a serine-proteinase domain. X-ray and neutron solution scattering was used to study the arrangement of these domains in factor I. Factor I was determined to be monomeric in solution, with an A280(1\%,1cm) of 12.3-14.1. Its radius of gyration (RG) was 3.96 nm by X-rays in a high positive solute-solvent contrast, and 3.84 nm by neutrons at infinite solute-solvent contrast. The cross-sectional radius of gyration (RXS) was likewise found to be 1.64 nm by X-rays and 1.55 nm by neutrons. The RG data were not noticeably dependent on the solute-solvent contrast, whereas the RXS data showed a small dependence. The maximum dimension of factor I was determined to be 12.8 nm from the RG and RXS data, and 14-15 nm from the X-ray and neutron distance distribution functions. This length is too short to account for a linear arrangement of the domains in factor I. Small sphere models were developed for factor I in which the largest domain was modelled from the crystal structure for beta-trypsin. The attachment of either an elliptical cylinder or a two-armed V-shaped structure to this domain to represent the remaining four small domains gave good scattering curve-fits for factor I, and were compatible with experimental sedimentation coefficients. The non-extended domain models for factor I imply that the steric accessibility of each domain will be reduced, and this may be important for its functional activity.},

They were discovered using an effective-medium theory, showing that their response is nonlocal in space and time. Recently, we generalized this theory to account for piezoelectricity, and demonstrated that the effective momentum can depend constitutively on the electric field, thereby enlarging the design space for metamaterials. Here, we develop the mathematical restrictions on the effective properties of such generalized Willis materials, owing to passivity, reciprocity, and causality. The establishment of these restrictions is of fundamental significance, as they test the validity of theoretical and experimental results—and applicational importance, since they provide elementary bounds for the maximal response that potential devices may achieve.},

Here, we investigate one-dimensional asymmetric piezoelectric Willis elements using heuristic homogenization, long-wavelength asymptotic analysis and numerical experiments. We show that in order to describe the heterogeneous scatterer using a homogenized description that respects reciprocity and energy conservation, anomalous electromomentum moduli must be included.

Surprisingly, this arena which was initially established and profoundly studied in electronic systems and crystals, has sparked a drive among classical physicists to pursue a wave-based analogy for sound, light and vibrations. In the latest efforts combining valley-contrasting topological sound with non-Hermitian ingredients, B. Hu et al.

In this contribution, we take a theoretical and numerical route towards understanding the complex acoustic interplay between geometry and added acoustic gain as inspired by the aforesaid publication. Besides complex bulk and edge states predictions and computations of mode-split resonances using whispering gallery configurations, we also predict an acoustic amplitude saturation in dependence on the activated coated elements. We foresee that our computational advances may assist future efforts in exploring thermoacoustic topological properties.},

In this viewpoint article, we describe the fundamentals of DAS beamforming. The underlying theory and numerical approach are detailed so that users can be aware of its functioning and limitations. In particular, we discuss the importance of the f-number and speed of sound on image quality, and propose one solution to set their values from a physical viewpoint. We suggest determining the f-number from the directivity of the transducer elements and the speed of sound from the phase dispersion of the delayed signals. Simplified Matlab codes are provided for the sake of clarity and openness. The effect of the f-number and speed of sound on the lateral resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio was investigated in vitro and in vivo. If not properly preset, these two factors had a substantial negative impact on standard metrics of image quality (namely CNR and FWHM). When beamforming with DAS in vitro or in vivo, it is recommended to optimize these parameters in order to use it wisely and prevent image degradation.},

The medium geometries considered include a semi-infinite geometry, an infinite-length cylinder evaluated along the azimuthal direction, and a sphere. Steady-state photon fluence rate in the cylinder and sphere geometries is represented by a form involving the physical source, its image with respect to the associated extrapolated half-plane, and a radius-dependent term, leading to simplified formula for estimating the DPFs. With the source-detector distance and medium optical properties held fixed across all three geometries, and equal radii for the cylinder and sphere, the DPF is the greatest in the semi-infinite and the smallest in the sphere geometry. When compared to the results from finite-element method, the DPFs analytically estimated for 10 to 25 mm source-detector separations on a sphere of 50 mm radius with mua=0.01 mm(-1) and mu's=1.0 mm(-1) are on average less than 5\% different. The approximation for sphere, generally valid for a diameter{$>$}/=20 times of the effective attenuation pathlength, may be useful for rapid estimation of DPFs in near-infrared spectroscopy of an infant head and for short source-detector separation.},

  abstract = {Navigation within a closed environment requires analysis of a variety of acoustic cues, a task that is well developed in many visually impaired individuals, and for which sighted individuals rely almost entirely on visual information. For blind people, the act of creating cognitive maps for spaces, such as home or office buildings, can be a long process, for which the individual may repeat various paths numerous times. While this action is typically performed by the individual on-site, it is of some interest to investigate at which point this task can be performed off-site, at the individual's discretion. In short, is it possible for an individual to learn an architectural environment without being physically present? If so, such a system could prove beneficial for navigation preparation in new and unknown environments. The main goal of the present research can therefore be summarized as investigating the possibilities of assisting blind individuals in learning a spatial environment configuration through the listening of audio events and their interactions with these events within a virtual reality experience. A comparison of two types of learning through auditory exploration has been performed: in situ real displacement and active navigation in a virtual architecture. The virtual navigation rendered only acoustic information. Results for two groups of five participants showed that interactive exploration of virtual acoustic room simulations can provide sufficient information for the construction of coherent spatial mental maps, although some variations were found between the two environments tested in the experiments. Furthermore, the mental representation of the virtually navigated environments preserved topological and metric properties, as was found through actual navigation.},

These stable shape-invariant photons, exhibiting circular-cylindrical symmetry, are familiar from laser optics, micromechanical manipulation, quantum optics, communication, and foundational studies in both classical optics and quantum physics. They are characterized, chiefly, by two mode numbers: the azimuthal index indicating the orbital angular momentum of the beam, which itself has spawned a burgeoning and vibrant subfield, and the radial index, which up until recently has largely been ignored. In this paper we develop a differential operator formalism for dealing with the radial modes in both the position and momentum representations and, more importantly, give the meaning of this quantum number in terms of a well-defined physical parameter: the intrinsic hyperbolic momentum charge.},

A deterministic model that describes the pressure fields inside the rooms in terms of eigenfunctions and uses the Dirichlet-to-Neumann technique in order to reproduce the slit effect is presented. An efficient formulation of the problem is obtained thanks to the splitting of the original domain into three domains: sending room, slit, receiving room. The geometry and boundary conditions of the problem can be modelled in detail like in an element-based numerical technique (such as the finite element method) but with smaller computational costs. The model is compared with numerical solutions, existent models and published experimental data. Afterwards it is used to analyse some aspects such as the influence of slit dimensions, opening position, room properties (dimensions and absorption) that cannot be taken into account with the available models. These usually suppose that the slit or opening connects two unbounded acoustic domains.},

  abstract = {Reproduction of a given sound field interior to a circular loudspeaker array without producing an undesirable exterior sound field is an unsolved problem over a broadband of frequencies. At low frequencies, by implementing the Kirchhoff–Helmholtz integral using a circular discrete array of line-source loudspeakers, a sound field can be recreated within the array and produce no exterior sound field, provided that the loudspeakers have azimuthal polar responses with variable first-order responses which are a combination of a two-dimensional (2D) monopole and a radially oriented 2D dipole. This paper examines the performance of circular discrete arrays of line-source loudspeakers which also include a tangential dipole, providing general variable-directivity responses in azimuth. It is shown that at low frequencies, the tangential dipoles are not required, but that near and above the Nyquist frequency, the tangential dipoles can both improve the interior accuracy and reduce the exterior sound field. The additional dipoles extend the useful range of the array by around an octave.},

  abstract = {Reproduction of spatial properties of recorded sound scenes is increasingly recognised as a crucial element of all emerging immersive applications, with domestic or cinema-oriented audiovisual reproduction for entertainment, telepresence and immersive teleconferencing, and augmented and virtual reality being key examples. Such applications benefit from a general spatial audio processing framework, being able to exploit spatial information from a variety of recording formats in order to reproduce the original sound scene in a perceptually transparent way.  Directional Audio Coding (DirAC) is a recent parametric spatial sound reproduction method that fulfils many of the requirements of such a framework. It is based on a universal 3D audio format known as B-format and achieves flexible and effective perceptual reproduction for loudspeakers or headphones.  Part of this work focuses on the model of DirAC and aims to extend it. Firstly, it is shown that by taking into account information of the four-channel recording array that generates the B-format signals, it is possible to improve both analysis of the sound scene and reproduction. Secondly, these findings are generalised for various recording configurations.  A further generalisation of DirAC is attempted in a spatial transform domain, the spherical harmonic domain (SHD), with higher-order B-format signals. Formulating the DirAC model in the SHD combines the perceptual effectiveness of DirAC with the increased resolution of higher-order B-format and overcomes most limitations of traditional DirAC.  Some novel applications of parametric processing of spatial sound are demonstrated for sound and music engineering. The first shows the potential of modifying the spatial information in the recording for creative manipulation of sound scenes, while the second shows improvement of music reproduction captured with established surround recording techniques.The effectiveness of parametric techniques in conveying distance and externalisation cues over headphones, led to research in controlling the perceived distance using loudspeakers in a room. This is achieved by manipulating the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio using a compact loudspeaker array with a variable directivity pattern.  Lastly, apart from reproduction of recorded sound scenes, auralisation of the spatial properties of acoustical spaces are of interest. We demonstrate that this problem is well-suited to parametric spatial analysis. The nature of room impulse responses captured with a large microphone array allows very high-resolution approaches, and such approaches for detection and localisation of multiple reflections in a single short observation window are applied and compared.},

  abstract = {Sound sources for measurements in room acoustics are of omni-directional type, in general. With respect to auralization applications, an omni-directionally measured room impulse response may not be the ideal choice since it does not represent the real life situation playing an instrument in the room. To achieve the directivity of a real source (like a musical instrument or human voice) with a technical sound source (like a loudspeaker) requires either to copy the entire body and the sound radiation (i.e. the surface velocity) of that particular source or to reproduce the directional pattern of the radiation using a multiple source configuration like a dodecahedron or icosahedron loudspeaker array with independent excitation of each transducer. The advantage of the latter method is obvious since one single source is able to provide a large variety of different directivities by simply changing the excitation profile. To maintain the appropriate excitation of each individual transducer, different approaches can be made. In this paper a method is described using a discretely measured target radiation pattern to calculate the frequency dependent excitation signals for each transducer. Hereby, the directivity pattern of the source transducers and a phase optimization of the energy averaged radiation of musical instruments are used. The advantage of this method is a very flexible computation that is able to match the radiation pattern at the points of measurement very well. The resulting input filters for the platonic sound source can be used either for a real time convolution or offline processing of measured signals.},

This type of device, however, is only able to levitate objects along one direction, at distances multiple of half of a wavelength. In this work, we show how a customised reflective acoustic metamaterial enables the levitation of multiple particles, not necessarily on a line and with arbitrary mutual distances, starting with a generic input wave. We establish a heuristic optimisation technique for the design of the metamaterial, where the local height of the surface is used to introduce delay patterns to the reflected signals. Our method stands for any type and number of sources, spatial resolution of the metamaterial and system’s variables (i.e. source position, phase and amplitude, metamaterial’s geometry, relative position of the levitation points, etc.). Finally, we explore how the strength of multiple levitation points changes with their relative distance, demonstrating sub-wavelength field control over levitating polystyrene beads into various configurations.},

We show that these unit cells achieve negative refraction, negative effective mass density, significantly nonunity bulk modulus, and are suitable for the design of negative refraction media and media with tunable gain and absorption. In this architecture, a transducer senses the pressure wave incident on the metamaterial and an electronic circuit manipulates the electric signal produced and drives a second transducer that creates the acoustic response consistent with the desired effective material parameters. The electronics between the two transducers allows easy dynamic tuning of these parameters. We show that this approach can be applied to both broadband and narrow band designs.},

However, for most practical applications that require unidirectionality at audio and low frequencies, subwavelength implementations capable of the necessary time-reversal symmetry breaking remain elusive. Here we describe a design approach based on metamaterial techniques that provides highly subwavelength and strongly non-reciprocal devices. We demonstrate this approach by designing and experimentally characterizing a non-reciprocal active acoustic metamaterial unit cell composed of a single piezoelectric membrane augmented by a nonlinear electronic circuit, and sandwiched between Helmholtz cavities tuned to different frequencies. The design is thinner than a tenth of a wavelength, yet it has an isolation factor of {$>$}10\,dB. The design method generates relatively broadband unidirectional devices and is a good candidate for numerous acoustic applications.},

We present a design approach that yields active metamaterials whose physical structure is fixed, yet their local acoustic response can be changed almost arbitrarily and in real time by configuring the digital electronics that control the metamaterial acoustic properties. We demonstrate this approach experimentally by designing a metamaterial slab configured to act as a very thin acoustic lens that manipulates differently three identical, consecutive pulses incident on the lens. Moreover, we show that the slab can be configured to simultaneously implement various roles, such as that of a lens and a beam steering device. Finally, we show that the metamaterial slab is suitable for efficient second harmonic acoustic imaging devices capable of overcoming the diffraction limit of linear lenses. These advantages demonstrate the versatility of this active metamaterial and highlight its broad applicability, in particular, to acoustic imaging.},

Despite decades of research on noise mitigation techniques, existing methods have significant limitations including inability to silence broadband noise and shield large volumes. Here we show theoretically and experimentally that acoustic bianisotropic materials with non-zero strain to momentum coupling are remarkably effective sound barriers. They surpass state-of-the-art sound isolators in terms of attenuation, bandwidth, and shielded volume. We implement our barriers with very compact active meta-atoms that owe their small size to their local response to external sound. Moreover, our active approach is not constrained by feedback stabilization requirements, in stark contrast with all traditional active sound control systems. Consequently, bianisotropic sound barriers have the potential to revolutionize noise control technologies and provide much needed solutions to an increasingly important and difficult challenge.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing with radar is typically an ill-posed linear inverse problem: a scene is to be inferred from limited measurements of scattered electric fields. Parsimonious models provide a compressed representation of the unknown scene and offer a means for regularizing the inversion task. The emerging field of compressed sensing combines nonlinear reconstruction algorithms and pseudorandom linear measurements to provide reconstruction guarantees for sparse solutions to linear inverse problems. This paper surveys the use of sparse reconstruction algorithms and randomized measurement strategies in radar processing. Although the two themes have a long history in radar literature, the accessible framework provided by compressed sensing illuminates the impact of joining these themes. Potential future directions are conjectured both for extension of theory motivated by practice and for modification of practice based on theoretical insights.},

  abstract = {Recent works show that two-channel decentralized active noise control (DANC) systems are able to achieve optimal noise reduction performance with guaranteed convergence by proper matrix eigenvalue shaping for each frequency. In this paper, we study the impact of three eigenvalue shaping approaches on the performance of a time-domain two-channel DANC system, where the first two approaches are from the literature and the third one is newly proposed as an extension of one of the two approaches. By theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of the three approaches, it is found that the eigenvalues of the 2~×~2 so-called characteristic matrices in the frequency-domain should be shaped by considering two aspects. Firstly, the two eigenvalues for each matrix need to be pushed towards the positive real axis to ensure stability. Secondly, the eigenvalues inherently affect the two auxiliary filters in the time-domain. They should be shaped so that the two filters have roughly the same magnitudes to facilitate implementation. Simulation results using the measured acoustic paths demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed eigenvalue shaping approach and the adaptive filtering technique for controlling sinusoidal noise, multitone noise, white noise and traffic noise. Experimental result shows the efficacy of the proposed approach for controlling white noise in three dimensional space.},

  abstract = {Of the many available reverberation time prediction formulas, Sabine's and Eyring's equations are still widely used. The assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of sound energy during the decay associated with those models are usually recognized as a reason for lack of agreement between predictions and measurements. At the same time, the inaccuracy in the estimation of the sound-absorption coefficient adds to the uncertainty of calculations. This paper shows that the error of incorrectly assumed sound absorption is more detrimental to the prediction precision than the inherent error in the formulas themselves. The proposed absorption calibration procedure reduces the differences between the measured and predicted reverberation time values, showing that an accuracy within ±10\% from the target reverberation time values can be achieved regardless of the absorption distribution in a room. The paper also discusses the oft neglected air absorption of sound, which may introduce considerable bias to the measurement results. The need for an air-absorption compensation procedure is highlighted, and a method for the estimation of its parameters in octave bands is proposed and compared with other approaches. The results of this study provide justification for the use of the Sabine and Eyring formulas for reverberation time predictions.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, the discussion is centered around the sound energy decay in enclosed spaces. The work starts with the methods to predict the reverberation parameters, followed by the room impulse response measurement procedures, and ends with an analysis of techniques to digitally reproduce the sound decay. The research on the reverberation in physical spaces was initiated when the first formula to calculate room's reverberation time emerged. Since then, finding an accurate and reliable method to predict reverberation has been an important area of acoustic research. This thesis presents a comprehensive comparison of the most commonly used reverberation time formulas, describes their applicability in various scenarios, and discusses their accuracy when compared to results of measurements. The common sources of uncertainty in reverberation time calculations, such as bias introduced by air absorption and error in sound absorption coefficient, are analyzed as well. The thesis shows that decreasing such uncertainties leads to a good prediction accuracy of Sabine and Eyring equations in diverse conditions regarding sound absorption distribution. The measurement of the sound energy decay plays a crucial part in understanding the propagation of sound in physical spaces. Nowadays, numerous techniques to capture room impulse responses are available, each having its advantages and drawbacks. In this dissertation, the majority of commonly used measurement techniques are listed, whereas the exponential swept-sine is described in more detail. This work elaborates on the external factors that may impair the measurements and introduce error to their results, such as stationary and non-stationary noise, as well as time variance. The dissertation introduces Rule of Two, a method of detecting nonstationary disturbances in sweep measurements. It also shows the importance of using median as a robust estimator in non-stationary noise detection. Artificial reverberation is a popular sound effect, used to synthesize sound energy decay for the purpose of audio production. This dissertation offers an insight into artificial reverberation algorithms based on recursive structures. The filter design proposed in this work offers precise control over the decay rate while being efficient enough for real-time implementation. The thesis discusses the role of the delay lines and feedback matrix in achieving high echo density in feedback delay networks. It also shows that four velvet-noise sequences are sufficient to obtain smooth output in interleaved velvet noise reverberator. The thesis shows that the accuracy of reproduction increases the perceptual similarity between measured and synthesised impulse responses. The insights collected in this dissertation offer insights into the intricacies of reverberation prediction, measurement and synthesis. The results allow for reliable estimation of parameters related to sound energy decay, and offer an improvement in the field of artificial reverberation.},

  abstract = {Vesicles are a highly attractive morphology to achieve in micellar dispersions of block copolymers (BCP) in epoxy thermosets due to the fact that small amounts can affect a large volume fraction of the matrix, a fact that is important for toughening purposes. However, generating vesicles in epoxy matrices requires operating in a narrow range of formulations and processing conditions. In this report, we show that block-copolymer vesicles dispersed in an epoxy matrix could be obtained through a sphere-to-cylinder-to-vesicle micellar transition induced by visible-light photopolymerization at room temperature. A 10 wt\% colloidal solution of poly(ethylene-co-butene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEB-b-PEO) block copolymer (BCP) in an epoxy monomer (DGEBA) self-assembled into spherical micelles as shown by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). During a slow photopolymerization of the epoxy monomer carried out at room temperature, a sphere-to-cylinder-to-vesicle transition took place as revealed by in situ SAXS and TEM images. This was driven by the tendency of the system to reduce the local interfacial curvature as a response to a decrease in the miscibility of PEO blocks in the polymerizing epoxy matrix. When the BCP concentration was increased from 10 to 20 and 40 wt\%, the final structure evolved from bilayer vesicles to multilayer vesicles and to lamellae, respectively. In particular, for 20 wt\% PEB-b-PEO, transient structures such as partially fused multilayered vesicles were observed by TEM, giving insight into the growth mechanism of multilayer vesicles. On the contrary, when a relatively fast thermal polymerization was performed at 80 degrees C, the final morphology consisted of kinetically trapped spherical and cylindrical micelles. Hopefully, this study will lead to new protocols for the preparation of vesicles dispersed in epoxy matrices in a controlled way.}

  abstract = {A quadrupole topological insulator, being one higher-order topological insulator with nontrivial quadrupole quantization, has been intensely investigated very recently. However, the tight-binding model proposed for such emergent topological insulators demands both positive and negative hopping coefficients, which imposes an obstacle in practical realizations. Here, we introduce a feasible approach to design the sign of hopping in acoustics, and construct the first acoustic quadrupole topological insulator that stringently emulates the tight-binding model. The inherent hierarchy quadrupole topology has been experimentally confirmed by detecting the acoustic responses at the bulk, edge, and corner of the sample. Potential applications can be anticipated for the topologically robust in-gap states, such as acoustic sensing and energy trapping.},

Compared to the commonly used acoustic contrast metric, IZI and IPI are generalized for multichannel audio and quantify the isolation of sound zones and of audio programs, respectively. The two metrics are shown to be generally non-interchangeable and suitable for different scenarios, such as generating dark zones (IZI) or minimizing audio-on-audio interference (IPI). Furthermore, two examples with free-field simulations are presented and demonstrate the applications of IZI and IPI in evaluating PSZ performance in different rendering modes and PSZ robustness.},

  abstract = {Discovering new topological phases of matter is a major theme in fundamental physics and materials science. Dirac semimetal provides an exceptional platform for exploring topological phase transitions under symmetry breaking. Recent theoretical studies have revealed that a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal can harbor fascinating hinge states, a higher-order topological manifestation not known before. However, its realization in experiment is yet to be achieved. In this Letter, we propose a minimum model to construct a spinless higher-order Dirac semimetal protected by C6v symmetry. By breaking different symmetries, this parent phase transitions into a variety of novel topological phases including higher-order topological insulator, higher-order Weyl semimetal, and higher-order nodal-ring semimetal. Furthermore, for the first time, we experimentally realize this unprecedented higher-order topological phase in a sonic crystal and present an unambiguous observation of the desired hinge states via momentum-space spectroscopy and real-space visualization. Our findings may offer new opportunities to manipulate classical waves such as sound and light.},

Recent studies reveal that a braided colliding nodal pair can be stabilized in a multi-gap system with \$\$PT\$\$or \$\$\{C\}\_\{2z\}T\$\$symmetry. This exemplifies non-abelian topological charges beyond the scope of conventional single-gap abelian band topology. Here, we construct ideal acoustic metamaterials to realize non-abelian braiding with the fewest band nodes. By emulating the time with a sequence of acoustic samples, we experimentally observe an elegant but nontrivial nodal braiding process, including nodes creation, braiding, collision, and repulsion (i.e., impossible to annihilate), and measure the mirror eigenvalues to elucidate the braiding consequence. The latter, at the level of wavefunctions, is of prime importance since essentially braiding physics aims to entangle multi-band wavefunctions. Furthermore, we experimentally unveil the highly intricate correlation between the multi-gap edge responses and the bulk non-abelian charges. Our findings pave the way for developing non-abelian topological physics that is still in its infancy.},

The effects of the conical angle of the wave vector components of the zero-order Bessel beam, the ratio of the radius of the sphere to the central spot radius of the zero-order Bessel beam, the shift of the beam waist center position along both the x and y axes, the permittivity and permeability tensor elements, and the loss of the sphere on the radar cross section (RCS) are numerically analyzed.

In acoustics, due to the longitudinal nature of sound transport in fluids, these phenomena are forbidden by symmetry, requiring the acoustic surface impedance to be inherently isotropic. Here we show that nonlocalities produced by strong coupling between neighboring impedance elements enable extreme anisotropic responses for sound traveling over a surface, supporting negative phase and energy velocities, as well as hyperbolic propagation for acoustic surface waves.},

We combine moving media with zero-index acoustic propagation, yielding extreme nonreciprocity and induced bianisotropy for modest applied speeds. The metamaterial is formed by an array of waveguides loaded by Helmholtz resonators, and it exhibits opposite signs of the refractive index sustained by asymmetric Willis coupling for propagation in opposite directions. We use this response to induce nonreciprocal positive-to-negative sound refraction, and we propose a nonreciprocal metamaterial lens focusing only with excitation from one side based on asymmetric Willis coupling.},

  abstract = {When sound interacts with geometrically asymmetric structures, it experiences coupling between pressure and particle velocity, known as Willis coupling. While in most instances this phenomenon is perturbative in nature, tailored asymmetries combined with resonances can largely enhance it, enabling exotic acoustic phenomena. In these systems, Willis coupling obeys reciprocity, imposing an even symmetry of the Willis coefficients with respect to time reversal and the impinging wave vector, which translates into stringent constraints on the overall scattering response. In this work, we introduce and experimentally observe a dual form of acoustic Willis coupling, arising in geometrically symmetric structures when time-reversal symmetry is broken, for which the pressure-velocity coupling is purely odd-symmetric. We derive the conditions to maximize this effect, we experimentally verify it in a symmetric subwavelength scatterer biased by angular momentum, and we demonstrate the opportunities for sound scattering enabled by odd Willis coupling. Our study opens directions for acoustic metamaterials, with direct implications for sound control, non-reciprocal scattering, wavefront shaping and signal routing, of broad interest also for nano-optics, photonics, elasto-dynamics, and mechanics.},

Here, by merging two concepts of phase gradient and PT symmetry together, we design and study a non-Hermitian acoustic gradient metasurface (i.e., metagrating). We show that the PT symmetry breaks spatially the symmetry of reflected wave diffraction in the acoustic metagrating, making it an asymmetric mirror. In particular, at the PT-ensured exceptional point, for incident waves from one side, such metagrating behaves as a phase gradient metasurface, in which high-efficiency retroreflection governed generalized Snell's law occurs. For an incident wave from the opposite direction, such a metagrating is a common grating, whose diffraction in the reflection follows the common diffraction equation. Our work builds a bridge connecting the phase gradient and passive PT symmetric system, enriching the methods for wavefront manipulation and exhibiting potential applications in the design of multifunctional acoustic devices.},

Also, active one-way transparent sheets with controllable copolarized reflection and transmission from the opposite side are feasible. We show that particular nonreciprocal magnetoelectric coupling inside the sheet is necessary to realize lossless nonactive transparent sheets. Furthermore, we derive the required polarizabilities of constituent dipole particles such that the layers composed of them form one-way transparent sheets.

  abstract = {Spherical loudspeaker arrays have been recently studied for directional sound radiation, where the compact arrangement of the loudspeaker units around a sphere facilitated the control of sound radiation in three-dimensional space. Directivity of sound radiation, or beamforming, was achieved by driving each loudspeaker unit independently, where the design of beamforming weights was typically achieved by numerical optimization with reference to a given desired beam pattern. This is in contrast to the methods already developed for microphone arrays in general and spherical microphone arrays in particular, where beamformer weights are designed to satisfy a wider range of objectives, related to directivity, robustness, and side-lobe level, for example. This paper presents the development of a physical-model-based, optimal beamforming framework for spherical loudspeaker arrays, similar to the framework already developed for spherical microphone arrays, facilitating efficient beamforming in the spherical harmonics domain, with independent steering. In particular, it is shown that from a beamforming perspective, the spherical loudspeaker array is similar to the spherical microphone array with microphones arranged around a rigid sphere. Experimental investigation validates the theoretical framework of beamformer design.},

  abstract = {Planar glass-etalon Fabry-Pérot (FP) optical ultrasound sensors offer an alternative to piezoelectric sensors for the measurements of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) fields and other metrological applications. In this work, a model of the frequency-dependent directional response of the FP sensor was developed using the global matrix method, treating the sensor as a multilayered elastic structure. The model was validated against the experimentally measured directional response of an air-backed cover-slip FP sensor with well-known material properties. In addition, the model was compared with the measurements of an all-hard-dielectric sensor suitable for HIFU measurements. The model was then used to calculate modal dispersion curves for both glass-etalon sensors, allowing the features of the directional response to be linked to specific wave phenomena. The features in the directivity of the air-backed cover-slip sensor are due to guided Lamb waves. Symmetric Lamb modes give rise to regions of high sensitivity, whereas anti-symmetric modes cause regions of low sensitivity. For the all-hard-dielectric sensor, two features correspond to the water-substrate and water-spacer compressional and shear critical angles. A region of high sensitivity close to the shear critical angle is associated with a leaky-Rayleigh wave, which has a frequency-dependent phase speed. At higher frequencies, this feature is counteracted by a region of low sensitivity, which occurs when there is no difference in the vertical displacement of the mirrors forming the FP cavity. The model may be used to improve and optimize the design of FP sensors or could be used to assist with the accurate deconvolution of the directional response from array measurements in metrological and imaging applications.},

We apply the Huygens-Fresnel wave-based electric field superposition (HF-WEFS) method combined with the radiating dipole approximation to compute the effects of scattering-induced distortions of focal excitation fields on the far-field CARS signal. We analyze the effect of spherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARS signal emitted by different objects (2mum diameter solid sphere, 2mum diameter myelin cylinder and 2mum diameter myelin tube). We find that distortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focal field but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase that modifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations further show that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numerical aperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS images formed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarized input fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers. Our computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizing scattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and may inspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.}

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of transducerintegrated apodization in row–column-addressed arrays and presents a beamforming approach specific for such arrays. Row–column addressing 2-D arrays greatly reduces the number of active channels needed to acquire a 3-D volume. A disadvantage of row–column-addressed arrays is an apparent ghost effect in the point spread function caused by edge waves. This paper investigates the origin of the edge waves and the effect of introducing an integrated apodization to reduce the ghost echoes. The performance of a λ/2-pitch 5-MHz 128 + 128 row–column-addressed array with different apodizations is simulated. A Hann apodization is shown to decrease imaging performance away from the center axis of the array because of a decrease in main lobe amplitude. Instead, a static roll-off apodization region located at the ends of the line elements is proposed. In simulations, the peak ghost echo intensity of a scatterer at (x,y, z) = (8, 3, 30) mm was decreased by 43 dB by integrating roll-off apodization into the array. The main lobe was unaffected by the apodization. Simulations of a 3-mm-diameter anechoic blood vessel at 30 mm depth showed that applying the transducer-integrated apodization increased the apparent diameter of the vessel from 2.0 mm to 2.4 mm, corresponding to an increase from 67\% to 80\% of the true vessel diameter. The line element beamforming approach is shown to be essential for achieving correct time-of-flight calculations, and hence avoid geometrical distortions. In Part II of this work, experimental results from a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer with integrated roll-off apodization are given to validate the effect of integrating apodization into the line elements.},

This unidirectional response forms the basis for devices such as acoustic isolators and circulators, and it also unlocks new functionalities for complex systems such as acoustic topological insulators. After reviewing the principles of acoustic reciprocity, we look at techniques to achieve large reciprocity breaking, including nonlinearities, moving media, spatiotemporal modulation, and nonlinear bianisotropy. We then discuss the recent surge of progress in nonreciprocal surface acoustic wave devices and topological acoustic systems, areas which we predict will continue to flourish in the coming years. We anticipate that these and other applications of nonreciprocity will continue to enhance acoustic technology and form the basis for new acoustic devices. Reciprocity is a fundamental principle in wave manipulation, and techniques for breaking its symmetry will continue to be discovered, refined, optimized, and applied to several acoustic domains as the understanding of the underlying principles and new technologies mature.},

We demonstrate that these bounds can be overcome by loading a piezoelectric transducer with a non-Foster active circuit, showing that its radiation bandwidth and efficiency can be largely extended beyond what is possible in passive radiators, fundamentally limited only by stability considerations. Based on these principles, we experimentally observe a threefold bandwidth enhancement compared to its passive counterpart, paving the way toward non-Foster acoustic radiation and more broadly active metamaterials that overcome the bandwidth constraints hindering passive systems.},

However, these algorithms require a large number of error microphones and provide only local attenuation. Slow convergence and high computational effort are additional disadvantages. We propose a wave-domain approach that converges instantaneously, operates with low computational effort and does not require error microphones. It inherently controls sound in all directions in the far-field. The soundfield from the aperture is matched in a least squares sense with the generated soundfield from the loudspeaker array using orthonormal basis functions. Compensation for algorithmic delay, induced by blockwise processing, can be based on microphone placement or signal prediction, at the cost of a loss in attenuation performance. Our simulation results indicate that wave-domain processing has the potential to outperform LMS-based methods in practical active noise control for apertures.},

We have conducted a study on the use of hollow 'integrating' moulds for more uniform light delivery of photodynamic therapy in irregularly shaped cavities such as the oral cavity. Simple geometries such as a cubical box, a sphere, a cylinder and a 'bottle-neck' geometry have been investigated experimentally and the results have been compared with computed light distributions obtained using the 'radiosity method'. A high reflection coefficient of the mould and the best uniform direct irradiance possible on the inside of the mould were found to be important determinants for achieving a uniform light distribution.},

The design of the directivity control filter is based on the least-squares method in the frequency domain. Circular loudspeaker arrays are considered to be rigid to avoid the forbidden frequency and for practical use. We compare the beam patterns with different shapes of arrays with a single frequency via computer simulation. These are evaluated by comparing the width of the main lobe and the directivity index. The two circular loudspeaker arrays can form a high-directivity beam with a narrower main lobe than that of the single circular loudspeaker array. The two circular loudspeaker arrays have more robust performances than that of the linear loudspeaker array.},

  abstract = {Allowing subwavelength-scale-digitization of optical wavefronts to achieve complete control of light at interfaces, metasurfaces are particularly suited for the realization of planar phase-holograms that promise new applications in high-capacity information technologies. Similarly, the use of orbital angular momentum of light as a new degree of freedom for information processing can further improve the bandwidth of optical communications. However, due to the lack of orbital angular momentum selectivity in the design of conventional holograms, their utilization as an information carrier for holography has never been implemented. Here we demonstrate metasurface orbital angular momentum holography by utilizing strong orbital angular momentum selectivity offered by meta-holograms consisting of GaN nanopillars with discrete spatial frequency distributions. The reported orbital angular momentum-multiplexing allows lensless reconstruction of a range of distinctive orbital angular momentum-dependent holographic images. The results pave the way to the realization of ultrahigh-capacity holographic devices harnessing the previously inaccessible orbital angular momentum multiplexing.},

The method relies on the reconstruction of the pressure and the particle velocity on the studied surface using an equivalent source method based on spherical array measurements. The sound field measured by the array is mainly composed of an incident and a reflected wave, so it can be represented as a spatially sparse problem. This makes it possible to use compressive sensing in order to enhance the resolution and the quality of the estimation. The results indicate an accurate reconstruction for angles of incidence between 0° and 60°, and between approximately 200 and 4000 Hz. Additionally, experimental challenges are discussed, such as the sample's finiteness at low frequencies and the estimation of the background noise.},

For complex boundaries, the use of numerical methods is generally preferred due to implementation simplicity, but usually results in great computational needs, especially in three dimensions. Analytical expressions are available, but are limited to simple geometries such as a diffusive slab, a sphere or a cylinder. An analytical approximation, the Kirchhoff approximation, also called the tangent-plane method is presented for the case of diffuse light. Using this approximation, analytical solutions of the diffusion equation for arbitrary boundaries and volumes can be derived. Also, computation time is minimized since no matrix inversion is involved. The accuracy of this approximation is evaluated on comparison with results from a rigorous numerical technique calculated for an arbitrary geometry. Performance of the approximation as a function of the optical properties and the size of the medium is examined and it is demonstrated that the computation time of the direct scattering model is reduced at least by two orders of magnitude.},

It involves subtracting a reference measurement including only direct sound from one with direct sound and a reflection, to isolate the reflection.

These variations cause small time differences between the reference and reflection measurements, which prevent complete subtraction of the direct sound; the residual direct sound then pollutes analysis of the isolated reflection.

The room acoustic conditions that make this possible, and the psycho-acoustic effects at work are not fully understood. This research utilizes auralizations from measured and simulated performance venues to investigate spatial discrimination of multiple acoustic sources in rooms. Signals were generated from measurements taken in a small theater, and listeners in the audience area were asked to distinguish pairs of speech sources on stage with various spatial separations. This experiment was repeated with the proscenium splay walls treated to be flat, diffusive, or absorptive. Similar experiments were conducted in a simulated hall, utilizing 11 early reflections with various characteristics, and measured late reverberation. The experiments reveal that discriminating the lateral arrangement of two sources is possible at narrower separation angles when reflections come from flat or absorptive rather than diffusive surfaces.},

  abstract = {We study the nonlinear interaction between two non-collinear light beams that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). More specifically, two incident beams interact at an angle in a medium with a second order nonlinearity and thus generate a third, non-collinear beam at the second harmonic frequency that experiences a reduced conversion efficiency in comparison to that expected based on conventional phase-matching theory. This reduction scales with the input beam OAM and, differently from previous spiral bandwidth calculations, is due to a geometric effect whereby the input OAM is projected along the non-collinear interaction direction. The effect is relevant even at small interaction angles and is further complicated at large angles by a non-conservation of the total OAM in the nonlinear interaction. Experiments are performed under different conditions and are in excellent agreement with the theory. Our results have implications beyond the specific case studied here of second-harmonic generation, in particular for parametric down-conversion of photons or in general for phase-matched non-collinear interactions between beams with different OAM.},

  abstract = {A simple approximate model is developed for ultrasonic wave propagation in a random elastic medium. The model includes second order multiple scattering and is applicable in all frequency ranges including geometric. It is based on the far field approximation of the reference medium Green's function and simplifications of the mass operator in addition to those of the first smooth approximation. In this approximation, the dispersion equation for the perturbed wave number is obtained; its solution yields the dispersive ultrasonic velocity and attenuation coefficients. The approximate solution is general and is suitable for nonequiaxed grains with arbitrary elastic symmetry. For equiaxed cubic grains, the solution is compared with the existing second order models and with the Born approximation. The comparison shows that the obtained solution has smaller error than the Born approximation and shows reasonably well the onset of multiple scattering and the applicability limit of the Born approximation at high frequency. The perturbed wave number in the developed model does not depend explicitly on the crystallite elastic properties even for arbitrary crystallographic symmetry; it depends on two nondimensional scattering elastic parameters and the macroscopic ultrasonic velocity (those are dependent on the crystallite moduli). This provides an advantage for potential schemes for inversion from attenuation to material microstructure.},

  abstract = {Regarding wave scattering on a three-dimensional nonspherical obstacle, the Rayleigh hypothesis states that the scattered field can be expanded everywhere outside the obstacle using only outgoing eigensolutions of the underlying Helmholtz equation. However, the correctness of this assumption has not yet been finally clarified, although it is important for the near-field analysis of scattering processes and for multiple scattering. To circumvent this uncertainty, Waterman introduced the extended boundary condition to develop his T-matrix method. This approach leads to the restriction that, when modeling multiple scattering processes using this T-matrix, the smallest circumscribing spheres of the individual obstacles must not overlap. The purpose of this paper is to provide a justification of the correctness of Rayleigh's hypothesis and clarify its implications for modeling multiple scattering. We show that Waterman's T-matrix can in fact be used inside the critical region between the surface of the obstacle and its smallest circumscribing sphere to represent the near-field and that one does not necessarily have to exclude an overlap of these spheres in the multiple scattering modeling. The theoretical considerations in the first part of this paper are supplemented by a numerical study of a benchmark configuration for multiple scattering in the last part.},

The KZK equation is a mathematical model that describes the nonlinear propagation of a finite-amplitude sound pulse in a thermo-viscous medium. The derivation of the KZK equation has to date been based on the paraxial approximation of small perturbations around a given state of the Navier-Stokes system. However, this method does not guarantee that the solution of the initial Navier-Stokes system can be reconstructed from the solution of the KZK equation. We introduce a corrector function in the derivation ansatz that allows one to validate the KZK-approximation. We also give the analysis of other types of derivation. We prove the validation of the KZK-approximation for the non-viscous case, as well as for the viscous nonlinear and linear cases. The results are obtained in Sobolev spaces for functions periodic in one of the space variables and with a mean value of zero. The existence of a unique regular solution of the isentropic Navier-Stokes system in the half space with boundary conditions that are both periodic and mean value zero in time is also obtained.},

Such an arrangement is useful in that the transducer can be used for transmitting to and receiving from a point (or line) source, and that it can eliminate the undesirable aperture effect that makes the transducer blind to waves traveling in certain directions and those of certain frequencies. In this paper, a comprehensive numerical analysis based on a wave propagation model is carried out for the study of characteristics and parameters of cones and wedges influencing their performance. We study the effect of the dimensions, shape and aperture on the frequency response and the angle of incidence of the wave. For computational accuracy and efficiency, the boundary element method is used in the analysis.},

  abstract = {Detecting a target by measuring its forward scattered field is of interest for harbor surveillance because target strength levels are generally higher in the forward direction than in the backward direction for simple geometries. An acoustic barrier based on forward scattering was demonstrated in a nearly range-independent shallow water environment. The experimental location was characterized by high reverberation, low temporal signal coherence, and, as a result, few stable multipath arrivals due to the fluctuating sea surface. This high-frequency experiment utilized a vertical source array, broadcasting broadside pulses, and a vertical receiver array spanning the water column. The signal of interest was the aberration (in space and time) caused by the acoustic forward scattering field of crossing targets (2-m-long aluminum cylinder, 1-m-diameter steel sphere and pair of scuba tanks). Hence, the spatial and temporal coherence of the recorded acoustic signals was first investigated to assess the stability of the early acoustic arrivals in this rapidly fluctuating coastal environment. A principal component analysis of the stable portion of the recorded acoustic signals was then used to determine the crossing time of the target and to isolate some of its scattered wavefield components.}

  abstract = {This paper discusses the design and operation of a measurement apparatus used to conduct scale-model underwater acoustic propagation experiments, presents experimental results for an idealized waveguide, and compares the measured results to data generated by two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the capability of the apparatus for a simple waveguide that primarily exhibits 2D acoustic propagation. The apparatus contains a computer-controlled positioning system that accurately moves a receiving transducer in the water layer above a scale-model bathymetry while a stationary source transducer emits broadband pulsed waveforms. Experimental results are shown for a 2.133\,m\,×\,1.219\,m bathymetric part possessing a flat-bottom bathymetry with a translationally invariant wedge of 10° slope along one edge. Beamformed results from a synthetic horizontal line array indicate the presence of strong in-plane arrivals along with weaker diffracted and horizontally refracted arrivals. A simulated annealing inversion method is applied to infer values for five waveguide parameters with the largest measurement uncertainty. The inferred values are then used in a 2D method of images model and a 3D adiabatic normal-mode model to simulate the measured acoustic data.},

We show theoretically that a PT-symmetric metasurface sensor may provide enhanced sensitivities compared to traditional passive sensors based on metamaterial/metasurface resonators, because the singular point of one-way zero reflection arising from the EP or the CPAL-related sharp resonance may result in dramatically modulated scattering responses or resonance offsets. We demonstrate the proposed concept with realistic metasurface sensors based on photopumped graphene metasurfaces that simultaneously offer terahertz optical gain and (bio)chemical sensing functions. The proposed PT-symmetric metasurfaces may impact not only loss compensation and extraordinary manipulation of electromagnetic waves, but also practical sensing and detection applications.},

In the formulation, image sources are divided into axial, tangential, and oblique groups, which chiefly contribute to the corresponding groups of normal modes in wave acoustics. Consequently, the total energy decay consists of seven kinds of exponential decay curves. Second, considering surface scattering on walls with scattering coefficients, an integrated reverberation theory for nondiffuse field is developed, where the total field is divided into specular and diffuse reflection fields. The specular reflection field is simply formulated by substituting specular absorption coefficients, while the diffuse reflection field is assumed to be a perfectly diffuse field, of which energy is supplied from the specular reflection field at each reflection. Finally, a theoretical case study demonstrates how surface scattering affects the energy decay in rectangular rooms with changing the aspect ratio and the absorption distribution.},

  abstract = {Holographic acoustic lenses (HALs), also known as acoustic holograms, are used for generating unprecedented complex focused ultrasound (FU) fields. HALs store the phase profile of the desired wavefront, which is used to reconstruct the acoustic pressure field when illuminated by a single acoustic source. Nonlinear effects occur as the sound intensity increases, leading to distorted and asymmetric waveforms. Here, the k-space pseudospectral method is used to perform homogeneous three-dimensional nonlinear acoustic simulations with power law absorption. An in-depth analysis is performed to study the evolution of holographic-modulated FU fields produced by HALs as the excitation amplitude increases. It is shown that nonlinear waveform distortion significantly affects the reconstruction of the pressure pattern when compared to the linear condition. Diffraction and nonlinear effects result in an asymmetric waveform with distinct positive and negative pressure patterns at the target plane. Peak positive pressure distribution becomes more localized around the areas with the highest nonlinear distortion. The peak signal-to-distortion ratio (PSDR) at the target plane falls while the nonuniformity index (NUI) rises. As a result of harmonic generation, the heat deposition distribution becomes highly localized with a significant increase in the NUI. Nonlinear effects have also been shown to flatten the peak negative pressure distribution while having minimal effect on the PSDR or NUI. However, nonlinear effects are shown to be critical for accurately predicting cavitation zones. Findings will pave the way for HALs implementation in high-intensity applications and prompt the incorporation of nonlinear acoustics into the notion of computer-generated holography.},

Typically, the RTF rapidly varies with varying source and receiver positions, hence requires an impractical number of point to point measurements to characterize a given room. Therefore, we derive a novel RTF parameterization that is robust to both receiver and source variations with the following salient features: 1) The parameterization is given in terms of a modal expansion of 3D basis functions. 2) The aforementioned modal expansion can be truncated at a finite number of modes given that the source and receiver locations are from two sizeable spatial regions, which are arbitrarily distributed. 3) The parameter weights/coefficients are independent of the source/receiver positions. Therefore, a finite set of coefficients is shown to be capable of accurately calculating the RTF between any two arbitrary points from a pre-defined spatial region where the source(s) lie and a pre-defined spatial region where the receiver(s) lie. A practical method to measure the RTF coefficients is also provided, which only requires a single microphone unit and a single loudspeaker unit, given that the room characteristics remain stationary over time. The accuracy of the above parameterization is verified using appropriate simulation examples.},

  abstract = {The direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), which describes the energy ratio between the direct and reverberant component of a soundfield, is an important parameter in many audio applications. In this paper, we present a multichannel algorithm, which utilizes the blind recordings of a spherical microphone array to estimate the DRR of interest. The algorithm is developed based on a spatial correlation model formulated in the spherical harmonics domain. This model expresses the cross correlation matrix of the recorded soundfield coefficients in terms of two spatial correlation matrices, one for direct sound and the other for reverberation. While the direct path arrives from the source, the reverberant path is considered to be a nondiffuse soundfield with varying directional gains. The direct and reverberant sound energies are estimated from the aforementioned spatial correlation model, which then leads to the DRR estimation. The practical feasibility of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using the speech corpus of the acoustic characterization of environments challenge. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method was able to effectively estimate the DRR of a large collection of reverberant speech recordings including various environmental noise types, room types and speakers.},

This effect is considered as the fingerprint of the existence of a full acoustic gap. Nevertheless, the comparison with our calculation of band structures shows that the triangular lattice has band states in that frequency range. We call them deaf bands. This contradictory result is explained by looking at the symmetry of the deaf bands; they cannot be excited by experiments of sound transmission.}

Acoustic nonreciprocity has predominately been achieved by approaches that introduce nonlinear interaction, mean-flow biasing, smart skins, and spatio-temporal parametric modulation into the system. Each approach suffers from at least one of the following drawbacks: the introduction of modulation tones, narrow band filtering, and the interruption of mean flow in fluid acoustics. We now show that an acoustic media that is non-local and active provides a new means to break reciprocity in a linear fashion without these deleterious effects. We realize this media using a distributed network of interlaced subwavelength sensor–actuator pairs with unidirectional signal transport. We exploit this new design space to create a stable metamaterial with non-even dispersion relations and electronically tunable nonreciprocal behavior over a broad range of frequencies.},

  abstract = {Lensless imaging is an important and challenging problem. One notable solution to lensless imaging is a single-pixel camera that benefits from ideas central to compressive sampling. However, traditional single-pixel cameras require many illumination patterns that result in a long acquisition process. Here, we present a method for lensless imaging based on compressive ultrafast sensing. Each sensor acquisition is encoded with a different illumination pattern and produces a time series where time is a function of the photon's origin in the scene. Currently available hardware with picosecond time resolution enables time tagging photons as they arrive to an omnidirectional sensor. This allows lensless imaging with significantly fewer patterns compared to regular single-pixel imaging. To that end, we develop a framework for designing lensless imaging systems that use ultrafast detectors. We provide an algorithm for ideal sensor placement and an algorithm for optimized active illumination patterns. We show that efficient lensless imaging is possible with ultrafast measurement and compressive sensing. This paves the way for novel imaging architectures and remote sensing in extreme situations where imaging with a lens is not possible.},

In this paper, we propose a filter design method using a window function shape as the desired directivity pattern to reduce the sidelobe levels. The proposed method consists of three steps. The first step defines a cost function with a criterion for the directivity pattern. Next, filter coefficients for each loudspeaker are calculated and stored while changing the window function shape of the desired directivity pattern. Finally, we determine the optimum filter coefficients having the best performance of the cost function by using a full-search algorithm at each frequency. We conducted directivity experiments with a real six-element circular loudspeaker array having a radius of 0.055 m and evaluated its directivity to confirm the performance of the proposed method. The results, which were compared with those obtained from a conventional method, showed that the maximum sidelobe level improved by about 2 dB, although the beam was wide. We verified that using the window function shape as the desired directivity pattern is more effective than using the conventional method for sidelobe suppression.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this article is to introduce a new nonlinear elastography based classification method for human breast masses. Multi-compression elastography imaging is elucidated in this study to differentiate malignant from benign lesions, based on their nonlinear mechanical behavior under compression. Three classification parameters were used and compared in this work: a new nonlinear parameter based on a power-law behavior of the strain difference between breast masses and healthy tissues, mass-soft tissue strain ratio and the mass relative volume between B-mode and elastography imaging. Using 3D elastography, these parameters were tested in vivo. A pilot study on 10 patients was performed, and results were compared with biopsy diagnosis as a gold standard. Initial elastography results showed a good agreement with biopsy outcomes. The new estimated nonlinear parameter had an average value of 0.163±0.063 and 1.642±0.261 for benign and malignant masses, respectively. Strain ratio values for the benign and malignant masses had an average value of 2.135±0.707 and 4.21±2.108, respectively. Relative mass volume was 0.848±0.237 and 2.18±0.522 for benign and malignant masses. In addition to the traditional normal axial strain, new strain types were used for elastography and constructed in 3D, including the first principal, maximum shear and Von Mises strains. The new strains provided an enhanced distinction of the stiff lesion from the soft tissue. In summary, the proposed elastographic techniques can be used as a noninvasive quantitative characterization tool for breast cancer, with the capability of visualizing and separating the masses in a three dimensional space. This may reduce the number of unnecessary painful breast biopsies.},

  abstract = {The goal of the study described here was to introduce new methods for the classification and visualization of human breast tumors using 3-D ultrasound elastography. A tumor's type, shape and size are key features that can help the physician to decide the sort and extent of necessary treatment. In this work, tumor type, being either benign or malignant, was classified non-invasively for nine volunteer patients. The classification was based on estimating four parameters that reflect the tumor's non-linear biomechanical behavior, under multi-compression levels. Tumor prognosis using non-linear elastography was confirmed with biopsy as a gold standard. Three tissue classification parameters were found to be statistically significant with a p-value {$<$} 0.05, whereas the fourth non-linear parameter was highly significant, having a p-value {$<$} 0.001. Furthermore, each breast tumor's shape and size were estimated in~vivo using 3-D elastography, and were enhanced using interactive segmentation. Segmentation with level sets was used to isolate the stiff tumor from the surrounding soft tissue. Segmentation also provided a reliable means to estimate tumors volumes. Four volumetric strains were investigated: the traditional normal axial strain, the first principal strain, von Mises strain and maximum shear strain. It was noted that these strains can provide varying degrees of boundary enhancement to the stiff tumor in the constructed elastograms. The enhanced boundary improved the performance of the segmentation process. In summary, the proposed methods can be employed as a 3-D non-invasive tool for characterization of breast tumors, and may provide early prognosis with minimal pain, as well as diminish the risk of late-stage breast cancer.},

For fewer wave emissions the inverse scattering problem is increasingly ill-posed. In this contribution we establish and investigate a solution based on compressive sensing (CS). This approach accounts for the lack of measurement data by assuming sparsity of the material parameters in an arbitrary basis. Using measurements obtained from a wire and a multi-tissue phantom, we evaluate the performance of our CS solution in comparison to synthetic aperture focussing, delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming and filtered backpropagation (FBP). Emitting only a single plane wave, the CS approach yields the best results for the sparse wire phantom in terms of sidelobe reduction and lateral -6 dB-widths. For the non-sparse multi-tissue phantom, we observe equivalent results for CS, DAS, and FBP when a single plane wave is emitted and a discrete cosine basis is employed as sparsifying transform.},

In particular, in point-gapped systems with periodic boundary conditions, a pair of dislocations may induce a non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of Hamiltonian eigenstates localize at only one of the two dislocations. An example of such a phase are two-dimensional systems exhibiting weak non-Hermitian topology, which are adiabatically related to a decoupled stack of Hatano-Nelson chains. Moreover, we show that strong two-dimensional point-gap topology may also result in a dislocation response, even when there is no skin effect present with open boundary conditions. For both cases, we directly relate their bulk topology to a stable dislocation non-Hermitian skin effect. Finally, and in stark contrast to the Hermitian case, we find that gapless non-Hermitian systems hosting bulk exceptional points also give rise to a well-localized dislocation response.},

  abstract = {In underwater acoustics it is necessary to take into account the wave scattering by the seafloor. For example, on sonar pictures the speckle noise proceeds from the constructive and destructive interferences between al‐lthe waves reflected by the elementary scatterers. The origins of this phenomenon are seafloor roughness and its acoustic properties, wave incidence, frequency, multiples reflections, the dimensions of the insonified surface, etc. The aim of this study is to characterize the scattering of waves exclusively from the roughness. Thus a hypothesis of perfectly reflecting surface is taken. Moreover, specific‐geometry periodic surfaces are considered to take into account the multiple reflections and the shadow area easily. Finally it is supposed that the roughness and the wavelength are of the same size. The models to describe the scattered field are based on Kirchhoff’s theory and on Fraunhoffer’s diffraction theory. Some experiences in the acoustic tank yield good agreement between theoretical and experimental results. They show that the orientation and the area of the insonified and observed surfaces are parameters for the scattering angles and for the relative scattered amplitudes.},

Microwave analog and theoretical methods were used to derive the scattered intensity and degree of polarization as a function of the scattering angle along with the extinction. All results refer to an ensemble or a cloud of identical particles because averages have been taken over random particle orientations. The degree of polarization, backscatter, and the radiation-pressure cross section are most sensitive to particle shape, implying that the use of Mie theory may be inappropriate for many applications.}

The design of planar arrays with a limited number of active elements yielding real-time 3D high-quality imaging, for all beam scanning orientations, is one of the current challenges. In this paper, an innovative transmission/reception solution, that involves a compact fully sampled 256-element array as transmitter and an optimized 256-element sparse array as receiver, able to fulfill all the previous requirements, is proposed. The sparse array is made up of a thinned version of the transmitter dense array (i.e., a proper subset of elements is used both to transmit and receive) surrounded by an annular sparse off-the-grid array. Both the positions and the weights of the sparse array are jointly optimized by minimizing a novel cost function by means of simulated annealing algorithm. The proposed solution is well-suited for real-time 3D imaging over 360° of azimuth and ±40° of inclination.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound medical imaging provides advantages over a traditional 2-D visualization method. However, the use of a 2-D array to acquire 3-D images may result in a transducer composed of thousands of elements and a large amount of data in the front-end, making it impractical to implement high volume rate imaging and individually control all elements with the scanner. This paper proposes an original approach, valid for wideband operations centered on the design center frequency, to maintain a limited number of active elements and firing events, while preserving high resolution and volume rate. A 7~MHz 2-D array is composed of two circular concentric subparts. In the inner footprint the elements are distributed following a regular grid, while in the outer subpart a sparse non-grid solution is adopted. The inner circular dense array is composed of 256 elements with a pitch of 0.5λ. The overall footprint, delimited by the outer subpart, is equivalent to a 256-element array with a pitch of 1.5λ. All the elements of the inner subpart are activated in transmission. Following an optimization procedure, both subparts, including a subset of the elements placed in the inner footprint (i.e., sparse on-the-grid array) and the elements spread over the outer subpart (i.e., sparse off-the-grid array) are used to receive. A total number of 256 elements, defined by the sum of elements distributed in the inner and outer subparts, is fixed in reception. The proposed approach implies a multiline reception strategy, where for each transmission 3~×~3 firing events occur in reception. The sparse receive array is optimized by using a simulated annealing optimization. An original cost function is designed specifically to achieve successful results in wideband conditions. The receive array is optimized in order to obtain consistent results for different signal bandwidths of the excitation pulse. For all the desired bandwidths, the optimized array will provide the recovery of the lower lateral resolution of the transmission phase and, at the same time, a significant reduction of the undesired side lobe raised in the 3-D two-way beam pattern. The 3-D two-way beam pattern analysis reveals that the proposed solution is able to guarantee a lateral resolution of 1.35~mm at a focus depth of 25~mm for the three fractional signal bandwidths of interest (i.e., 30\%, 50\% and 70\%) considered in the optimization process. The undesired side lobes are successfully suppressed especially when, as a consequence of the multiline strategy, non-coincident steering angles are used in transmission and reception. Moreover, thanks to the firing scheme adopted, a high-volume rate of 63 volumes per second may be achieved at the focus depth. The volume rate decreases to 32 volumes per second at twice the focal depth. Phantom image simulations show that the proposed method maintains a satisfactory and almost uniform image quality in terms of resolution and contrast for all the signal bandwidths of interest.},

  abstract = {Acoustic meta-atoms serve as the building blocks of metamaterials, with linear properties designed to achieve functions such as beam steering, cloaking, and focusing. They have also been used to shape the characteristics of incident acoustic fields, which led to the manipulation of acoustic radiation force and torque for development of acoustic tweezers with improved spatial resolution. However, acoustic radiation force and torque also depend on the shape of the object, which strongly affects its scattering properties. We show that by designing linear properties of an object using metamaterial concepts, the nonlinear acoustic effects of radiation force and torque can be controlled. Trapped objects are typically small compared with the wavelength, and are described as particles, inducing monopole and dipole scattering. We extend such models to a polarizability tensor including Willis coupling terms, as a measure of asymmetry, capturing the significance of geometrical features. We apply our model to a three-dimensional, subwavelength meta-atom with maximal Willis coupling, demonstrating that the force and the torque can be reversed relative to an equivalent symmetrical particle. By considering shape asymmetry in the acoustic radiation force and torque, Gorkov’s fundamental theory of acoustophoresis is thereby extended. Asymmetrical shapes influence the acoustic fields by shifting the stable trapping location, highlighting a potential for tunable, shape-dependent particle sorting.},

The proposed approach is based on the description of the sound field inside the aperture in terms of propagating and evanescent acoustic modes. The radiation of the aperture is accounted for using a modal radiation impedance matrix. The coupled problem is solved in terms of modal contribution factors. The convergence of the approach is then investigated and the model is validated by comparisons with existing models for various configurations and excitations. Several numerical examples are provided regarding the normal incidence and diffuse field TL for various apertures and the relationship between these two indicators is discussed.},

  abstract = {Enclosures are commonly used to reduce the sound exposure of workers to the noise radiated by machinery. Some acoustic predictive tools ranging from simple analytical tools to sophisticated numerical deterministic models are available to estimate the enclosure acoustical performance. However, simple analytical models are usually valid in limited frequency ranges because of underlying assumptions whereas numerical models are commonly limited to low frequencies. This paper presents a general and simple model for predicting the acoustic performance of large free-standing enclosures which is capable of taking into account the complexity of the enclosure configuration and covering a large frequency range. It is based on the statistical energy analysis (SEA) framework. The sound field inside the enclosure is calculated using the method of image sources. Sound transmission across the various elements of the enclosure is considered in the SEA formalism. The model is evaluated by comparison with existing methods and experimental results. The effect of several parameters such as enclosure geometry, panel materials, presence of noise control treatments, location of the source inside the enclosure, and presence of an opening has been investigated. The comparisons between the model and the experimental results show a good agreement for most of the tested configurations.},

  abstract = {In finite difference time domain simulation of room acoustics, source functions are subject to various constraints. These depend on the way sources are injected into the grid and on the chosen parameters of the numerical scheme being used. This paper addresses the issue of selecting and designing sources for finite difference simulation, by first reviewing associated aims and constraints, and evaluating existing source models against these criteria. The process of exciting a model is generalized by introducing a system of three cascaded filters, respectively, characterizing the driving pulse, the source mechanics, and the injection of the resulting source function into the grid. It is shown that hard, soft, and transparent sources can be seen as special cases within this unified approach. Starting from the mechanics of a small pulsating sphere, a parametric source model is formulated by specifying suitable filters. This physically constrained source model is numerically consistent, does not scatter incoming waves, and is free from zero- and low-frequency artifacts. Simulation results are employed for comparison with existing source formulations in terms of meeting the spectral and temporal requirements on the outward propagating wave.},

There were a few formulas available in various books and papers to realize the transformation between plane wave and cylindrical wave. However, many of the formulas are limited to Bessel functions of the first kind or Hankel functions of order 0. This paper is mainly concerned with the plane-wave expansions of cylindrical waves. For the completeness, we first give the expansion of a plane wave in terms of cylindrical waves. After that, we derive the integral expression for the plane-wave expansion of Bessel function of the first kind.

  abstract = {Eliminating the grating lobes is significant in ultrasonics. For example, highly efficient ultrasound focus and flexible focus steering without off-target heating for medical applications require the total rejection of grating lobes and side lobes. We investigate analytically, numerically, and experimentally the physical causes of grating lobes in ultrasound beam engineering. We find that the generation of grating lobes is attributed to two main factors, namely, the diffraction from the finite-sized source array and the different phase delays of the phased array. Based on these findings, we design and implement an active acoustic metasurface to completely eliminate the grating lobes. The lab-made metasurface comprises 16 × 16 square-lattice elements of subwavelength thickness, where each element is a supercell with 4 × 4 piezoelectric sheets in a matrix of epoxy resin. By tailoring the ratio of the supercell width over the lattice constant, the grating lobes due to the structure diffraction can be completely suppressed. With a programmable multichannel drive, we further impose Gaussian-shaped amplitude modulation on the metasurface to wipe out the grating lobes induced by inhomogeneous phase delays. Our experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the active metasurface with programmable phase and amplitude modulations shows a high performance in grating-lobe-proof and steerable ultrasound focusing.},

  abstract = {Active noise control (ANC) headphones are commonly used to reduce annoyed noise around users’ ears. Most commercial ANC headphones utilize specific filters with pre-trained coefficients due to their fast response and robustness. However, when dealing with primary noises coming from different directions, their noise reduction performance suffers significantly. Hence, we proposed an adaptive gain (AG) algorithm on the fixed filters with multi-reference method, in which the control signal is formed by adaptively weighting and summing the output signals of multiple fixed filters that have been pre-trained from primary noise with different directions of arrival. By combining the adaptive algorithm with the fixed filter approach, the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional fixed ANC approach in noise reduction performance. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm’s step-size bound and time constant, demonstrating its robustness and fast convergence behavior. Furthermore, comparative simulations and real-time experiments with commercial ANC headphone and other adaptive algorithms show its efficacy in dealing with multiple noise sources in the actual scenario.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the mechanism of self-stabilizing, three-dimensional Mie particle manipulation in water via an acoustic tweezer with a single transducer. A carefully designed acoustic lens is attached to the transducer to form an acoustic vortex, which provides angular momentum on the trapped polymer sphere and leads to a fast-spinning motion. The sphere can find equilibrium positions spontaneously during the manipulation by slightly adjusting its relative position, angular velocity, and spinning axis. The spinning motion greatly enhances the low-pressure recirculation region around the sphere, resulting in a larger pressure induced drag. Simultaneously, the Magnus effect is induced to generate an additional lateral force. The spinning motion of the trapped sphere links the acoustic radiation force and hydrodynamic forces together, so that the sphere can spontaneously achieve new force balance and follow the translational motion of the acoustic tweezer. Non-spherical objects can also be manipulated by this acoustic tweezer.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, the majority of research on the parametric loudspeaker has concentrated on the nonlinear modeling of acoustic propagation and pre-processing techniques to reduce nonlinear distortion in sound reproduction. There are, however, very few studies on directivity control of the parametric loudspeaker. In this paper, we propose an equivalent circular Gaussian source array that approximates the directivity characteristics of the linear ultrasonic transducer array. By using this approximation, the directivity of the sound beam from the parametric loudspeaker can be predicted by the product directivity principle. New theoretical results, which are verified through measurements, are presented to show the effectiveness of the delay-and-sum beamsteering structure for the parametric loudspeaker. Unlike the conventional loudspeaker array, where the spacing between array elements must be less than half the wavelength to avoid spatial aliasing, the parametric loudspeaker can take advantage of grating lobe elimination to extend the spacing of ultrasonic transducer array to more than 1.5 wavelengths in a typical application.},

  abstract = {In an active noise control (ANC) application, a conventional loudspeaker is deployed as the control source to transmit an anti-noise wave, which eventually suppress the noise in the targeted area and result in a quite zone. A well-known drawback of such an ANC application is that the sound pressure level at locations other than the control point may undesirably in-crease due to the loudspeaker's omnidirectional beampattern. Hence, the feasibility of using a parametric loudspeaker as the control source in an ANC application has recently been studied and validated in experiments. However, the low-frequency sound field created by a parametric loudspeaker can reach up to 8 meters (given by the absorption distance of 40 kHz wave in air) from the surface of its ultrasonic emitter. The spillover of the anti-noise wave remains unsolvable within this region. To address this problem, this paper proposes to use the length-limited parametric source, which is recently reported by Kamakura et al. [Applied Acoustics 73, 1231 (2012)], in ANC applications. The length-limited parametric source consists of two parametric loudspeakers on the same axis. Different carrier frequencies are applied to the two parametric loudspeakers to result in different absorption lengths. By adjusting the input amplitudes and phases of the two parametric loudspeakers, their secondary sound waves can suppress each other in the overlapped sound fields but retain in the difference area. Thus, using the length-limited parametric source, the maximum noise cancellation can be achieved only at a particular spot, without disturbing neighboring areas. A new doubly-nested parameter adjustment structure is introduced for cancelling the secondary sound field outside the control spot and yet achieve noise reduction within the spot. The Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov (KZK) equation is adopted to model the parametric loudspeaker in the simulation, and the results show the potentials of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Earlier attempts to deploy two units of parametric loudspeakers have shown encouraging results in improving the accuracy of spatial audio reproductions. As compared to a pair of conventional loudspeakers, this improvement is mainly a result of being free of crosstalk due to the sharp directivity of the parametric loudspeaker. By replacing the normal parametric loudspeaker with the steerable parametric loudspeaker, a flexible sweet spot can be created that tolerates head movements of the listener. However, spatial aliasing effects of the primary frequency waves are always observed in the steerable parametric loudspeaker. We are motivated to make use of the spatial aliasing effects to create two sound beams from one unit of the steerable parametric loudspeaker. Hence, a reduction of power consumption and physical size can be achieved by cutting down the number of loudspeakers used in an audio system. By introducing a new parameter, namely the relative steering angle, we propose a stereophonic beamsteering method that can control the amplitude difference corresponding to the interaural level difference (ILD) between two sound beams. Currently, this proposed method does not support the reproduction of interaural time differences (ITD).},

These PT phase transitions contribute significantly to the design of single mode lasers, coherent perfect absorbers, isolators, and diodes. However, such exceptional points are extremely difficult to access in practice because of the dispersive behaviour of most loss and gain materials required in PT symmetric systems. Here we introduce a method to systematically tame these exceptional points and control PT phases. Our experimental demonstration hinges on an active acoustic element that realizes a complex-valued potential and simultaneously controls the multiple interference in the structure. The manipulation of exceptional points offers new routes to broaden applications for PT symmetric physics in acoustics, optics, microwaves and electronics, which are essential for sensing, communication and imaging.},

The sound output is mainly confined in the beam of the ultrasonic carrier and thus shows a pronounced directivity. There are three parameters that together influence the output volume of a PAL. They are the input level, modulation index, and ultrasound level. In existing PALs, the volume knob is associated with the ultrasound level, while the modulation index is either fixed in the circuit or rarely adjustable by another knob. In this paper, an automatic gain control is proposed to improve the sound quality of the PAL by minimizing the modulation index, maintaining the output-to-input ratio, and ensuring the ultrasound level within the safety range. Simulation and measurement results validate that the proposed approach leads to a reduction in the average total harmonic distortion (THD) level by more than one third for all the tested modulation methods.},

It has been proven that the U2VF is a more generic model as compared to the audio-to-audio Volterra filter (A2VF), when the modulation method is adaptive or the input is time varying. However, there is no explicit solution to a linearization system based on the U2VF. Therefore, this paper proposes a synthesis method to extract A2VFs from the U2VF based on the parallel cascade structure. The mature technique of building a linearization system based on the A2VF can hence be adapted to consort with the U2VF.},

However, the transmission rate of acoustic communication is always limited by the narrow-frequency bandwidth of the acoustic waves because of the large attenuation for high-frequency sound in water. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput communication approach using the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of acoustic vortex beams with one order enhancement of the data transmission rate at a single frequency. The topological charges of OAM provide intrinsically orthogonal channels, offering a unique ability to multiplex data transmission within a single acoustic beam generated by a transducer array, drastically increasing the information channels and capacity of acoustic communication. A high spectral efficiency of 8.0 ± 0.4 (bit/s)/Hz in acoustic communication has been achieved using topological charges between −4 and +4 without applying other communication modulation techniques. Such OAM is a completely independent degree of freedom which can be readily integrated with other state-of-the-art communication modulation techniques like quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase-shift keying (PSK). Information multiplexing through OAM opens a dimension for acoustic communication, providing a data transmission rate that is critical for underwater applications.},

We successfully measured the acoustic spin, and spin-induced torque acting on a designed lossy acoustic probe that results from absorption of the spin angular momentum. The acoustic spin is also observed in the evanescent field of a guided mode traveling along a metamaterial waveguide. We found spin–momentum locking in acoustic waves whose propagation direction is determined by the sign of spin. The observed acoustic spin could open a new door in acoustics and its applications for the control of wave propagation and particle rotation.},

Usually a large number of measurements is required for the usual NAH methods since a large number of parameters in the source or field model need to be determined. However, a large-scale microphone measurement is costly and hard to perform, so the use of NAH is limited by practical experimental conditions. In the present work, with the motivation of decreasing the number of microphone measurements required, and thus facilitating the measurement process, two sparse Equivalent Source Method (ESM) algorithms were studied: i.e., Wideband Acoustical Holography (WBH) and l\_1-norm minimization. Based on these two algorithms, a new hybrid NAH procedure was proposed and demonstrated. To study and verify the above mentioned algorithms, simulations of different sources were conducted and then experiments were conducted on different sources: i.e., a loudspeaker cabinet and a diesel engine.},

  abstract = {The active noise control (ANC) is a complementary technique to the passive noise control (PNC) to reduce the low frequency noise. The ANC controller can be implemented by pre-trained filters or adaptive filters. The adaptive ANC controller is advantageous in its adaptation to environmental changes. However, the algorithm complexity of the adaptive ANC controller increases with the scale of ANC applications, making it difficult to be carried out on low-cost processors. To resolve this problem, cloud computing should be utilized in ANC systems, and thus the wireless networked ANC system is proposed. Since it is crucial for ANC controllers to generate the anti-noise wave in real time, this paper formulates a digital twin architecture that implements the control filter adaptation in the cloud and the anti-noise signal generation on the local controller, respectively. A digital twin filtered-reference least mean squares (DT-FxLMS) algorithm is proposed to coordinate the digital twin with the local controller. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the wireless networked ANC system based on the digital twin architecture.},

This can be extended to the case when the primary wave is amplitude-modulated thus resulting in the harmonic distortion of the self-demodulated wave. This paper proposes the extended convolution model with Westervelt's directivity and Berktay's directivity respectively. The angle-dependent harmonic distortion of the parametric loudspeaker is thereafter investigated, which is a topic not often mentioned in previous literature but is of significance in practice. The measurement, numerical simulation and model results are compared for the case when the double sideband (DSB) modulation is adopted and the frequency response of the ultrasonic emitter is a known factor. The comparison validates that the extended convolution model provides accurate predictions that are consistent with the measurement results and the extended convolution model is a simpler way to compute the far-field directivity of an amplitude-modulated parametric loudspeaker as compared to the numerical simulation.},

  abstract = {Practical active noise control (ANC) systems, like the active noise cancellation headphone, usually adopt a control filter with preset coefficients to achieve satisfactory noise reduction performance for dynamic noise and higher robustness. In this strategy, selecting the appropriate control filter for different types of noise is critical to the noise cancellation performance, and this selection mechanism is typically determined by trial and error. Hence, this paper proposes a computation-efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network capable of selecting the most suitable pre-trained control filter for each distinct primary noise. Applying the similarity matching method allows the proposed model to have a better generalization and can even deal with zero-shot noise, whose class does not exist in the training set. The Large-margin softmax (L-softmax) is also investigated to improve the proposed model's performance. Furthermore, when dealing with the N-shot learning problem, where there are few known real-world noise samples for the ANC system, an additional fine-tuning strategy is used to improve control filter selection accuracy. Numerical simulations on measured primary and secondary paths validate the proposed method's efficacy.},

  abstract = {Summary             Two-dimensional time-harmonic multiple scattering problems are addressed for a finite number of elliptical objects placed in wedge-shaped acoustic domains including half-plane and right-angled corners. The method of separation of variables in conjunction with the addition theorems is employed in the elliptical coordinates. The wavefunctions are represented in terms of radial and angular Mathieu functions. The method of images is applied to consider the effect of the infinitely long flat boundaries which are perfectly reflecting: either rigid or pressure release. The wedge angle is \$\textbackslash pi/n\$ rad with integer \$n\$; image ellipses must be appropriately rotated to realise the mirror reflection. Then, the ‘image conditions’ are developed to reduce the number of unknowns by expressing the unknown expansion coefficients of image scattered fields in terms of real counterparts. Use of image conditions, therefore, leads to the \$4n\^2\$-fold reduction in the size of a matrix for direct solvers and \$2n\$-times faster computation in building the system of linear equations than the approach without using them. Multiple scattering models using image conditions are formulated for rigid, pressure release and fluid ellipses under either plane- or cylindrical-wave incidence, and are numerically validated by the boundary element method. Furthermore, potential applications are presented: arrays of elliptically shaped scatterers make in situ tunable noise barriers by rotating scatterers. Finally, polar-coordinate image conditions (for circular objects) are also discussed when coordinates local to circles are also rotated. In Appendix, analytic formulae are provided, which permits the elliptical-coordinate addition theorems used in this article to be calculated by summation instead of numerical integration.},

Structural modulation of the nonionic fluorinated micelle induced by temperature change, surfactant concentration, and the added fluorinated oils have been systematically studied. The SAXS data were analyzed by the indirect Fourier transformation (IFT), and the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) depending on the volume fraction of the surfactant. Various plausible classical model calculations have been performed to confirm the consistency of the GIFT analysis of the SAXS data. Upon successive increase in temperature, the cylindrical micelles formed at lower temperatures undergo a continuous one-dimensional growth and ultimately near the cloud point an indication of flat planar like structural pattern is observed. The evolution in structure of particle near the demixing temperature may be due to onset of attractive interactions. The shape and size of the micelle is apparently unaffected by changing the surfactant concentration from 1 to 5 wt\% at 25 degrees C. Nevertheless, addition of small amount of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) oil, of structure F(CF(2)CF(2)CF(2)O)(n)CF(2)CF(2)COOH (n approximately 21) modulate the micellar shape and size. Long cylindrical micelles eventually transform into globular like particles. The onset cylinder-to-sphere transition in the structure of micelles in the surfactant/water/oil system is probably due to amphiphilic nature of the oil, which tends to increase the spontaneous curvature. The lipophilic part of the oil tends to reside in the micellar core, whereas, the hydrophilic part goes close to the polar head group of the surfactant so that effective cross-sectional area per surfactant molecules increases and as a result spherical micelles tend to form. Perfluorodecalin (PFD) also decreases size of the micelles but its effect is poor compared to the PFPE oil.},

The C8F17EO20 forms micelles and different liquid crystal phases depending on the temperature and composition. The fluorocarbon micellar structure induced by temperature or composition change and added fluorocarbon cosurfactant has been systematically studied. The SAXS data were analyzed by the indirect Fourier transformation (IFT) and the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) depending on the volume fraction of the surfactant and complemented by plausible model calculations. The C8F17EO20 forms spherical type micelles above critical micelle concentration (cmc) in the dilute region. The micelle tends to grow with temperature; however, the growth is not significant on changing temperature from 15-75 degrees C, which is attributed to the higher clouding temperature of the surfactant ({$>$}100 degrees C). On the other hand, the micellar structure (shape and size) is apparently unaffected by composition (1-25 wt \%) at 25 degrees C. Nevertheless, addition of fluorocarbon cosurfactant of structure C8F17SO2N(C3H7)(CH2CH2O)H (abbreviated as C8F17EO1) to the semidilute solution of C8F17EO20 (25 wt \%) favors micellar growth, which finally leads to the formation of viscoelastic wormlike micelles, as confirmed by rheometry and supported by SAXS. The onset sphere-to-wormlike transition in the structure of micelles in the C8F17EO20/water/C8F17EO1 system is due to the fact that the C8F17EO1 tends to go to the surfactant palisade layer so that the critical packing parameter increases due to a decrease in the effective cross-sectional area of the headgroup. As a result, spherical micelles grow into a cylinder, which after a certain concentration entangle to form a rigid network structure of wormlike micelles.}

  abstract = {Structure of diglycerol monolaurate (abbreviated as C(12)G(2)) micelles in nonpolar oils cyclohexane and n-octane as a function of compositions, temperatures, and surfactant chain length has been investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The SAXS data were evaluated by the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) method and real-space structural information of particles was achieved. Conventional poly(oxyethylene) type nonionic surfactants do not form reverse micelles in oils unless a trace water is added. However, present surfactant C(12)G(2) formed reverse micelle (RM) in cyclohexane and n-octane without addition of water at normal room temperature. A clear signature of one dimensional (1-D) micellar growth was found with increasing C(12)G(2) concentration. On the other hand, increasing temperature or hydrocarbon chain length of surfactant shorten the length of RM, which is essentially a cylinder-to-sphere type transition in the aggregate structure. Drastic changes in the structure of RM, namely, transition of ellipsoidal prolate to long rod-like micelles was observed upon changing oil from cyclohexane to octane. All the microstructural transitions were explained in terms of critical packing parameter.},

  abstract = {Willis fluids, or more generally Willis materials, are homogenized composites that exhibit coupling between momentum and strain. This coupling is intrinsic to inhomogeneous media and can play a significant role in the overall response in acoustic metamaterials. In this paper, we draw connections between bianisotropy in electromagnetism and Willis coupling in elastodynamics to provide a qualitative understanding. Building upon these analogies, we introduce a homogenization technique for acoustic metamaterials based on a source-driven, multiple scattering approach that highlights the physical origins of Willis coupling. Moreover, through numerical examples, we compare several macroscopic material descriptions of acoustic metamaterials with non-negligible Willis coupling. The descriptions neglecting Willis coupling may not satisfy restrictions stemming from reciprocity, passivity, and causality, which suggests that including Willis coupling in macroscopic descriptions is necessary to realize physically meaningful macroscopic parameters.},

Specifically, a beam tracer is used for calculating the image sources and reflection paths. The roughness of the surfaces is taken into account in post-processing. A single reflection is assumed to distribute the energy according to an exponential function in time based on Biot’s rough surface modeling theory. Multiple reflections are modeled with convolutions of exponential functions which are approximated as gamma functions.},

  abstract = {Vibro-acoustography (VA) is a medical imaging method based on the nonlinear interaction of two or more distinct ultrasound beams whose frequencies differ by several kHz. In turn, the interacting waves produce a difference-frequency signal which carries the information of the imaged tissue region. Two mechanisms are responsible for the difference-frequency generation (DFG) in VA, namely the dynamic (oscillatory) radiation force and the scattering of sound-by-sound. The role and importance of each phenomenon in VA is assessed here. A theoretical model based on Westervelt's equation for the DFG in the nonlinear scattering of two incident ultrasound waves by a small rigid sphere (compared to the incident wavelengths) is presented. Furthermore, a scattering experiment using VA is devised and the data show very good agreement with the proposed theory. The results reveal that the effect of scattering of sound-by-sound is the dominant component in the DFG in VA rather than the dynamic radiation force.},

  abstract = {Background To evaluate the prevalence, density, and distribution of prostate calcification in patients with prostate cancer. Methods Patients who underwent both Gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT and MRI of the prostate over the course of a year were selected for analysis. The CT images with visible calcifications within the prostate were included and calcifications automatically isolated using a threshold of 130 HU. The corresponding multiparametric MRI was assessed and the peripheral zone, transition zone, MRI-visible tumor, and urethra manually contoured. The contoured MRI and CT images were registered using rigid registration, and calcifications mapped automatically to the MRI contours. Results A total of 85 men (age range 50–88, mean 69 years, standard deviation 7.2 years) were assessed. The mean serum Prostate Specific Antigen PSA was 16.7, range 0.12 to 94.4. Most patients had intermediate-risk disease (68\%; Gleason grade group 2 and 3), 26\% had high-risk disease (Gleason grade group 4 and 5), and 6\% had low-risk disease (Gleason grade group 1). Forty-six patients out of 85 (54\%) had intraprostatic calcification. Calcification occurred more in transition zone than the peripheral zone (65\% vs. 35\%). The mean density of the calcification was 227 HU (min 133, max 1,966 HU). In 12 patients, the calcification was within an MRI-visible tumor, in 24 patients, there were calcifications within a 9 mm distance of the tumor border, and in 9 patients, there were calcifications located between the urethra and tumor. Conclusions Calcifications are common in patients with prostate cancer. Their density and location may make them a significant consideration when planning treatment or retreatment with some types of minimally invasive therapy.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a design approach for a shunted electrodynamic metamaterial (EDMM) for broadband robust vibration control. A unit cell of 12 inertial electrodynamic transducers is proposed, where the response of each transducer is tuneable via a connected resistive and inductive shunt circuit. The variations in the parameters of an off-the-shelf transducer are characterised experimentally, before the effect of this variation on the shunted response is investigated. It is shown that instability of the system is a limiting design factor. A problem is proposed whereby the resistive and inductive shunt values of an EDMM attached to a parametrically uncertain structure are to be found, and given the complexity of the design problem, a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is utilised to find a solution using an analytical model of the system. The results of the optimisation show that the effects of uncertainty in the actuators must be included, otherwise, the solution can be unstable. However, it is also shown that it is sufficient to ignore the uncertainty in the structure and optimise the EDMM considering actuator uncertainty alone, since the EDMM motion is then highly damped and, therefore, inherently robust to structural uncertainties.},

The essential part in formulations of bulk-boundary correspondence is a general and computable definition of topological invariants. In this Letter, we introduce a construction of non-Hermitian topological invariants based directly on real-space wave functions, which provides a general and straightforward approach for determining non-Hermitian topology. As an illustration, we apply this formulation to several representative models of non-Hermitian systems, efficiently obtaining their topological invariants in the presence of non-Hermitian skin effect. Our formulation also provides a dual picture of the non-Bloch band theory based on the generalized Brillouin zone, offering a unique perspective of bulk-boundary correspondence.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of cosmic microwave background(CMB) in 1965, the cosmological information encoded in it has motivated many ground and space observation programs to attempt to exploit its scientific potential. SPIDER is a balloon-borne telescope designed in particular to map the polarization pattern of the CMB at degree angular scales.SPIDER’s science instruments consist of 6 independent telescopes, operating at 94 and 150 GHz (SPIDER-1), with the second flight augmented by a suite of 285 GHz receivers (SPIDER-2). The cosmological results from SPIDER-1 were published in 2021, including a limit on the cosmological B-mode detection using the XFaster power spectrum estimator as its main pipeline. The second flight of SPIDER is being characterized at Princeton University while waiting for a launch opportunity from Antarctica. This thesis includes an introduction of CMB polarization, the SPIDER program, and the data analysis and result of SPIDER-1 in Chapter 1. We derive 95\% upper limits on the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio r from Feldman-Cousins and Bayesian constructions, finding r {$<$} 0.11 and r {$<$} 0.19 respectively. Following the results from SPIDER-1, Chapter 2 focuses on the XFaster spectrum estimator that was used as SPIDER’s main analysis pipeline and the SPIDER-1 consistency tests performed using this estimator. SPIDER-1 passes the outlier and distribution null test in two frequencies using 500 end-to-end simulations, with a PTE value of 0.78 and 0.56 respectively for the case of the combined frequencies.  The details of the SPIDER-2 cryogenic system and operation are in Chapter 3, while the 280 GHz telescope integration and characterization are introduced in Chapter 4. New data at 280 GHz from this second flight will complement the first flight, providing archival measurements of the polarized Galactic dust emission.},

  abstract = {Traditional matched-field processing (MFP) refers to array processing algorithms, which fully exploit the physics of wave propagation to localize underwater acoustic sources. As a generalization of plane wave beamforming, the “steering vectors,” or replicas, are solutions of the wave equation descriptive of the ocean environment. Thus, model-based MFP is inherently sensitive to environmental mismatch, motivating the development of robust methods. One such method is the array invariant (AI), which instead exploits the dispersion characteristics of broadband signals in acoustic waveguides, summarized by a single parameter known as the waveguide invariant β. AI employs conventional plane wave beamforming and utilizes coherent multipath arrivals (eigenrays) separated into beam angle and travel time for source-range estimation. Although originating from the ideal waveguide, it is applicable to many realistic shallow-water environments wherein the dispersion characteristics are similar to those in ideal waveguides. First introduced in 2006 and denoted by χ, the dispersion-based AI has been fully integrated with β. The remarkable performance and robustness of AI were demonstrated using various experimental data collected in shallow water, including sources of opportunity. Further, it was extended successfully to a range-dependent coastal environment with a sloping bottom, using an iterative approach and a small-aperture array. This paper provides an overview of AI, covering its basic physics and connection with β, comparison between MFP and AI, self-calibration of the array tilt, and recent developments such as adaptive AI, which can handle the dependence of β on the propagation angle, including steep-angle arrivals.},

To do so, the proposed model uses an elevation-dependent head radius that is individualized from anthropometry. Calculations of ITD for 12 listeners show that the proposed model is able to capture this elevation dependence and, for high frequencies and at large azimuths, yields a reduction in mean ITD error of up to 13 microseconds (3\% of the measured ITD value), compared to the SHM. For low-frequency ITDs, this reduction is up to 160 microseconds (23\%).},

Since ILD at low frequencies (typically f {$<$} 700 Hz) is a dominant cue for near-field distance perception in the free-field, a simple formula akin to the Woodworth formula for high-frequency interaural time difference, may be beneficial to easily and efficiently implement distance- and direction-dependent LF-ILDs for real-time spatial audio applications on devices with limited computational resources. By evaluating the limit as f → 0 of the infinite series representation of the RS-HRTF for finite source distances, an exact, closed-form expression for the “DC gain” as a function of source distance and direction is derived. For a given source location, using this expression to compute the DC gain at the left and right “ears,” and then taking the ratio of the two quantities gives the desired LF-ILD. As an example, it is shown that the derived formula may be used to extrapolate far-field ILD spectra of a rigid sphere to the near-field exactly for low frequencies and with sufficiently high accuracy for higher frequencies. Furthermore, the derived formula, like the Woodworth formula, is well-suited to individualization.},

  abstract = {Two different methods are presented for efficient computation of two-dimensional wave fields in focal regions. Both methods are valid for arbitrarily large relative apertures. One method is based on the impulse-response integral and the other on the angular-spectrum representation. The latter method is used to analyze the discrepancy between applying the Kirchhoff or the Debye assumption to obtain an approximation for the field in the aperture. Two cases of idealized incident waves are analyzed in detail. First, we treat the case of a perfect incident wave, i.e., a wave that, in the limit of an infinitely large aperture, would produce a δ-function field distribution on the focal line if account were taken of evanescent waves. Second, the incident wave is taken to be the field radiated by a point source and subsequently focused by a lens that delays the phase of the incoming wave in a perfect manner without influencing its amplitude. The latter wave has the same phase distribution over the aperture as the perfect wave, but a different amplitude distribution.},

  abstract = {Mathematical scattering models are derived and compared with data from zooplankton from several gross anatomical groups--fluidlike, elastic shelled, and gas bearing. The models are based upon the acoustically inferred boundary conditions determined from laboratory backscattering data presented in part I of this series [Stanton et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 103, 225-235 (1998)]. The models use a combination of ray theory, modal-series solution, and distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA). The formulations, which are inherently approximate, are designed to include only the dominant scattering mechanisms as determined from the experiments. The models for the fluidlike animals (euphausiids in this case) ranged from the simplest case involving two rays, which could qualitatively describe the structure of target strength versus frequency for single pings, to the most complex case involving a rough inhomogeneous asymmetrically tapered bent cylinder using the DWBA-based formulation which could predict echo levels over all angles of incidence (including the difficult region of end-on incidence). The model for the elastic shelled body (gastropods in this case) involved development of an analytical model which takes into account irregularities and discontinuities of the shell. The model for gas-bearing animals (siphonophores) is a hybrid model which is composed of the summation of the exact solution to the gas sphere and the approximate DWBA-based formulation for arbitrarily shaped fluidlike bodies. There is also a simplified ray-based model for the siphonophore. The models are applied to data involving single pings, ping-to-ping variability, and echoes averaged over many pings. There is reasonable qualitative agreement between the predictions and single ping data, and reasonable quantitative agreement between the predictions and variability and averages of echo data.},

The algorithm, based on the convolution model of the imaging system developed in frequency domain, accounts for the beam pattern of the finite-sized transducer used in the synthetic aperture. The 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used for the calculation of a 2D spectrum of the ultrasonic data. The spectrum is then interpolated to convert the polar coordinate system used for the acquisition of ultrasonic signals to the rectangular coordinates used for the presentation of imaging results. After compensating the transducer lobe amplitude profile using a Wiener filter, the transformed spectrum is subjected to the 2D inverse Fourier transform to get the time-domain image again. The algorithm is computationally attractive due to the use of 2D FFT. The performance of the proposed frequency-domain algorithm and the classical time-domain SAFT are compared in the paper using simulated and real ultrasonic data.},

  abstract = {In recent years, underwater acoustic (UWA) communications have received much attention as their applications have begun to shift from military toward commercial. Digital communications through UWA channels differ substantially from those in other media, such as radio channels, due to severe signal degradations caused by multipath propagation and high temporal and spatial variability of the channel conditions. The design of underwater acoustic communication systems has until recently relied on the use of noncoherent modulation techniques. However, to achieve high data rates on the severely band-limited UWA channels, bandwidth-efficient modulation techniques must be considered, together with array processing for exploitation of spatial multipath diversity. The new generation of underwater communication systems, employing phase-coherent modulation techniques, has a potential of achieving at least an order of magnitude increase in data throughput. The emerging communication scenario in which the modern underwater acoustic systems mill operate is that of an underwater network consisting of stationary and mobile nodes. Current research focuses on the development of efficient signal processing algorithms, multiuser communications in the presence of interference, and design of efficient modulation and coding schemes. This paper presents a review of recent results and research problems in high-speed underwater acoustic communications, focusing on the bandwidth-efficient phase-coherent methods. Experimental results are included to illustrate the state-of-the-art coherent detection of digital signals transmitted at 30 and 40 kb/s through a rapidly varying one-mile shallow water channel.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate high-precision dispersion tailoring in a metamaterial waveguide for wave compression and spatially tunable signal amplification. Spatial control over refractive index is achieved via digital controllers connected to piezoelectric unit cells. The digital shunt circuits allow numerically optimized circuit parameters to be uploaded directly to the experimental platform, enabling arbitrary spatial programming of the refractive index of the waveguide. Thus, the system acts as a reconfigurable piezoelectric array, altering the wavelength and group velocity of a given wave according to user specifications. In this work, optimizations are performed to implement gradual wave compression, realizing an effect analogous to that of an acoustic black hole. At the operating frequency of the design, the waveguide exhibits increased sensitivity and amplification of piezoelectric voltage output due to the compressed wavelength, shunt circuit resonance, and gradual variation in unit cell properties, avoiding internal reflections. Numerical and experimental results show that voltage amplification can be achieved in a desired position and frequency in the metamaterial waveguide.},

  abstract = {This work investigates the sound energy decays and flows in the Süleymaniye Mosque in İstanbul. This is a single-space superstructure having multiple domes. The study searches for the non-exponential sound energy decay characteristics. The effect of different material surfaces and volumetric contributions are investigated using acoustic simulations and in situ acoustical measurements. Sound energy decay rates are estimated by Bayesian decay analysis. The measured data reveal double- or triple-slope energy decay profiles within the superstructure. To shed light on the mechanism of energy exchanges resulting in multi-slope decay, spatial sound energy distributions and energy flow vectors are studied by diffusion equation model (DEM) simulations. The resulting sound energy flow vector maps highlight the contribution of a sound-reflective central dome contrasted with an absorptive carpeted floor in providing delayed energy feedback. In contrast, no multi-slope energy decay pattern is observed in DEM simulations with a bare marble floor, which generates a much more diffuse sound field than in the real situation with a carpeted floor. The results demonstrate that energy fragmentation, in support of the non-exponential energy decay profile, is due to both the sound absorption characteristics of materials and to their distributions, as well as to relations between the subvolumes of the mosque's interior.},

This experiment was designed to determine whether or not this combination tone is a result of measurable cochlear activity. Young, normal-hearing musicians matched the pitch and rated the loudness of combination tones perceived in the presence of pairs of pure tones. These matches and ratings were compared with distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) generated by the same tone pairs. While there was some variability in listener performance, with some listeners making inconsistent pitch matches across trials, listeners who gave consistent responses pitch matched the combination tone to a frequency close to the strongest DPOAE. This suggests that the perception of combination tones is associated with physical activity within the cochlea.}

In this paper, we relax the above constraint by constructing a system utilizing multiple circular microphone and loudspeaker arrays and designing a corresponding ANC algorithm. By simulation, we show that the proposed method can achieve comparable ANC performance to conventional spherical array methods.

This results in disclination-induced non-Hermitian skin effects. By doubling a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to a Hermitian three-dimensional chiral topological insulator, we show that the disclination-induced skin modes are zero modes of the effective surface Dirac fermion(s) in the presence of a pseudomagnetic flux induced by disclinations. Furthermore, we find that our results have a field theoretic description, and the corresponding geometric response actions (e.g., the Euclidean Wen-Zee action) enrich the topological field theory of non-Hermitian systems.},

  abstract = {Spherical harmonic analysis has been a widely used approach for spatial audio processing in recent years. Among all applications that benefit from spatial processing, spatial Active Noise Control (ANC) remains unique with its requirement for open spherical microphone arrays to record the residual sound field throughout the continuous region. Ideally, a low delay spherical harmonic recording algorithm for open spherical microphone arrays is desired for real-time spatial ANC systems. Currently, frequency domain algorithms for spherical harmonic decomposition of microphone array recordings are applied in a spatial ANC system. However, a Short Time Fourier Transform is required, which introduces undesirable system delay for ANC systems. In this paper, we develop a time domain spherical harmonic decomposition algorithm for the application of spatial audio recording mainly with benefit to ANC with an open spherical microphone array. Microphone signals are processed by a series of pre-designed finite impulse response (FIR) filters to obtain a set of time domain spherical harmonic coefficients. The time domain coefficients contain the continuous spatial information of the residual sound field. We corroborate the time domain algorithm with a numerical simulation of a fourth order system, and show the proposed method to have lower delay than existing approaches.},

  abstract = {As the dominant information carrier in water, the acoustic wave is widely used for underwater detection, communication and imaging. Even though underwater acoustic communication has been greatly improved in the past decades, it still suffers from slow transmission speeds and low information capacity. The recently developed acoustic orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing communication promises a high efficiency, large capacity and fast transmission speed for acoustic communication. However, the current works on OAM multiplexing communication mainly appear in airborne acoustics. The application of acoustic OAM for underwater communication remains to be further explored and studied. In this paper, an impedance matching pentamode demultiplexing metasurface is designed to realize multiplexing and demultiplexing in underwater acoustic communication. The impedance matching of the metasurface ensures high transmission of the transmitted information. The information encoded into two different OAM beams as two independent channels is numerically demonstrated by realizing real-time picture transfer. The simulation shows the effectiveness of the system for underwater acoustic multiplexing communication. This work paves the way for experimental demonstration and practical application of OAM multiplexing for underwater acoustic communication.},

Conventionally, spatial ANC is achieved by using complex error microphone arrays such as grid or spherical geometry, which are impractical and obstruct the users to enter the quiet region. Recently, the remote microphone technique has been introduced to spatial ANC systems without using error microphones inside the region of interest. However, this technique still requires an error microphone array during the tuning stage. In this paper, we further improve the remote microphone technique by introducing a spatial sound field recording method with a moving higher order microphone for the noise field recording (tuning stage) as well as secondary channel estimations (control stage). This eliminates the requirement for impractical microphone array geometries, typically required in existing spatial ANC solutions. The experimental data based simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on noise reduction over space with its feasible array design.},

The proposed method explicitly considers a discretized FDTD scheme and optimizes the initial value directly in the time domain so that every effect of the discretization error of FDTD, including numerical dispersion, is taken into account. It is also able to consider a frequency-wise directivity by integrating the Fourier transform into the optimization procedure, even though the estimated result is defined in the time domain. After the optimization, the obtained result can be utilized in any acoustic simulation based on the same FDTD scheme without modification because the result is represented as the initial value to be propagated and no additional procedure is required.},

Modeling of the directivity pattern of a sound source is also important for obtaining realistic simulation results. However, there has been little research on this. Although there has been research on sound source identification, the results might not be in a suitable form for numerical simulation. In this paper, a method for modeling a sound source from measured data is proposed. It utilizes the sum of monopoles as the physical model, and the modeling is achieved by estimating the model parameters. The estimation method is formulated as a convex optimization problem by assuming the smoothness of a solution and the sparseness of parameters. Moreover, an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving the problem is derived. The validity of the method is evaluated using simulated data, and the modeling result for an actual loudspeaker is shown.},

Two inaudible ultrasonic frequencies are produced from the parametric array. Due to the nonlinearity of air, it is possible to produce an audible frequency with its frequency equal to the difference in the two ultrasonic frequencies. However, there is not much work done in controlling the beam pattern of the difference frequency generated by the primary waves. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to control the sidelobe level of the difference frequency directivity. By making use of array signal processing techniques, the algorithm is also capable of producing a constant beamwidth for broadband difference frequency.},

As most of the time the sampling frequency is not high enough, the smallest steering angle available is large, which is undesirable. This limitation also occurs when performing beamsteering in a parametric array digitally. Although partial delay or frequency domain algorithms can be used to improve the steering angle, most of the algorithms are either computational intensive or introduce error during the process. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to beamsteer the difference frequency in parametric array. The proposed system can be used to steer the difference frequency to a small angle, without the need to increase the sampling frequency or implement partial delay.},

However, these devices are generally not fully adaptable and often use resonant cavities, which only exhibit nonreciprocal behaviour over a narrow bandwidth. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this paper investigates how wave-based active control can be used to achieve broadband nonreciprocal behaviour in a one-dimensional environment. Wave-based controller architectures are described for both transmission and absorption control and, through simulation and experimental implementations, it is shown that they can achieve broadband nonreciprocal behaviour. Importantly, the direction of nonreciprocal behaviour can be straightforwardly reversed.},

  abstract = {This review article deals with the regularization of the boundary element formulations for solution of boundary value problems of continuum mechanics. These formulations may be singular owing to the use of two-point singular fundamental solutions. When the physical interpretation is irrelevant for this topic of computational mechanics, we consider various mechanical problems simultaneously within particular sections selected according to the main topic. In spite of such a structure of the paper, applications of the regularization techniques to many mechanical problems are described. There are distinguished two main groups of regularization techniques according to their application to singular formulations either before or after the discretization. Further subclassification of each group is made with respect to basic principles employed in individual regularization techniques. This paper summarizes the substances of the regularization procedures which are illustrated on the boundary element formulation for a scalar potential field. We discuss the regularizations of both the strongly singular and hypersingular integrals, occurring in the boundary integral equations, as well as those of nearly singular and nearly hypersingular integrals arising when the source point is near the integration element (as compared to its size) but not on this element. The possible dimensional inconsistency (or scale dependence of results) of the regularization after discretization is pointed out. Finally, we discuss the numerical approximations in various boundary element formulations, as well as the implementations of solutions of some problems for which derivative boundary integral equations are required.},

First, noise levels can be reduced at the targeted locations, while the sound pressure levels at the other locations are not affected. Second, the cross-talk secondary path models can be removed, because the sound field reproduced by one PAL has negligible interference with the other PALs. When the proposed ANC system is implemented with fixed coefficient noise control filters, the computational complexity is further reduced. Based on a real-time implementation in a digital signal processor (DSP), experiment results are obtained to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ANC system.},

Therefore, the proposed ANC system employs the feedforward structure and adopts the parametric array loudspeakers (PALs) as the secondary sources. The PAL is a type of directional loudspeaker that generates a much narrower sound field as compared to the conventional loudspeaker. Once the proposed ANC system has been trained offline, the error microphones can be removed.

Here we propose the array configuration of hyperuniform disorder, which is short-range random while correlated at large scales, as a promising alternative distribution of acoustic antennas in phased arrays. Angle-resolved measurements reveal that the proposed array suppresses grating lobes and maintains a minimal radiation region in the vicinity of the main lobe for the primary frequency waves. These distinctive emission features benefit the secondary frequency wave in canceling the grating lobes regardless of the frequencies of the primary waves. Besides that, the hyperuniform disordered array is duplicatable, which facilitates extra-large array design without any additional computational efforts.},

  abstract = {Planar virtual sound barrier systems have been used successfully to reduce noise radiation through an opening without affecting natural ventilation and lighting. However, the complexity of a fully coupled control system grows at the rate proportional to the square of the number of channels and this make the system implementation become impractical for enclosures with large openings. To reduce the system complexity, this paper proposes an independent planar virtual sound barrier, which is a multi-channel system consisting of many independent single channel active noise control systems. Each single channel system is ‘‘independent” in the sense that the control source output of the system is updated only with the signal from its own error sensor. Based on the analytical model of sound radiation through the opening of a rectangular enclosure, the transfer functions from both primary and control sources are calculated first. Then the noise reduction performance, the stability, and the convergence behavior of both fully coupled and independent planar virtual sound barrier systems are investigated. It is found that the independent system with no control output constraint becomes inherently unstable at some frequencies; however its stability can be improved by applying some control output constraint. Reducing the number of channels and the distance between secondary loudspeakers and error microphones can also increase system stability but at the cost of smaller noise reduction. When the system is inherently stable and there is no constraint on control output, the independent system can provide the same noise reduction as the fully coupled one but with faster convergence speed.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a local active noise control system that virtually increases the sound isolation of a dividing wall by means of a secondary source array. With the proposed method, sound pressure on the source side of the partition is reduced using an array of loudspeakers that generates destructive interference on the wall surface, where an array of error microphones is placed. The reduction of sound pressure on the incident side of the wall is expected to decrease the sound radiated into the contiguous room. The method efficiency was experimentally verified by checking the insertion loss of the active noise control system; in order to investigate the possibility of using a large number of actuators, a decentralized FXLMS control algorithm was used. Active control performances and stability were tested with different array configurations, loudspeaker directivities and enclosure characteristics (sound source position and absorption coefficient). The influence of all these parameters was investigated with the factorial design of experiments. The main outcome of the experimental campaign was that the insertion loss produced by the secondary source array, in the 50–300 Hz frequency range, was close to 10 dB. In addition, the analysis of variance showed that the active noise control performance can be optimized with a proper choice of the directional characteristics of the secondary source and the distance between loudspeakers and error microphones.},

Energy levels and recommended labels involving exact and approximate quantum numbers for the main isotopologues of water in the gas phase, H216O, H218O, H217O, HD16O, HD18O, HD17O, D216O, D218O, and D217O, are determined from measured transition frequencies. The transition frequencies and energy levels are validated using first-principles nuclear motion computations and the MARVEL (measured active rotational–vibrational energy levels) approach. The extensive data including lines and levels are required for analysis and synthesis of spectra, thermochemical applications, the construction of theoretical models, and the removal of spectral contamination by ubiquitous water lines. These datasets can also be used to assess where measurements are lacking for each isotopologue and to provide accurate frequencies for many yet-to-be measured transitions. The lack of high-quality frequency calibration standards in the near infrared is identified as an issue that has hindered the determination of high-accuracy energy levels at higher frequencies. The generation of spectra using the MARVEL energy levels combined with transition intensities computed using high accuracy ab initio dipole moment surfaces are discussed. A recommendation of the TG is for further work to identify a single, suitable model to represent pressure- (and temperature-) dependent line profiles more accurately than Voigt profiles.},

  abstract = {High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is gaining rapid clinical acceptance as a treatment modality enabling non-invasive tissue heating and ablation for numerous applications. HIFU treatments are usually carried out in a single session, often as a day case procedure, with the patient either fully conscious, lightly sedated or under light general anaesthesia. A major advantage of HIFU over other thermal ablation techniques is that there is no necessity for the transcutaneous insertion of probes into the target tissue. The high powered focused beams employed are generated from sources placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumours of the liver, kidney, breast, uterus, pancreas and bone) or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), and are designed to enable rapid heating of a target tissue volume, while leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively unaffected. Given the wide-ranging applicability of HIFU, numerous extra-corporeal, transrectal and interstitial devices have been designed to optimise application-specific treatment delivery. Their principle of operation is described here, alongside an overview of the physical mechanisms governing HIFU propagation and HIFU-induced heating. Present methods of characterising HIFU fields and of quantifying HIFU exposure and its associated effects are also addressed.},

  abstract = {Sound Source Localization (SSL) has numerous applications namely machinery noise control, machinery fault localization, localization of explosives and weaponry in defense, development of hearing aids and robot’s auditory system. Beamforming and holographic SSL methods require numerous microphones and measurements for predicting source location; hence are highly expensive and time consuming. The simpler alternatives require less microphones; but are inaccurate, require high SNR, and have space of non-convergence where source cannot be uniquely localized. There is also a lack of method to localize pure harmonic sources. This paper proposes a method that addresses these limitations by accurately and quickly identifying the exact location of a harmonic sound source in the complete 3D space in acoustic free-field using just five acoustic signals. The novelties of this method are: new array design, spatially averaged Time Delay Estimation (TDE), TDE-ER (Energy Ratio) based localization, ER to remove mirror points, spectral de-noising, and solution of non-convergence. The method is rigorously tested through numerous simulations and real-life free-field experiments. A performance comparison shows that proposed method is more accurate (6.7\% error) compared with the existing 3D SSL technique (11.7\% error). Overall, it accurately identifies the coordinates of dominant sound source with 9.17\% mean error, in presence of inherent sensor noise (14~dB SNR onwards) and background noise (8~dB SNR onwards) in complete 3D space. Interestingly, the sound source location, and sound source frequency is found to effect the consistency of TDE-based SSL methods. The presented work paves way for further advancement in 3D SSL.},

  abstract = {Spherical microphone and circular microphone arrays are useful for sampling sound fields that may be resynthesized with loudspeaker arrays. Spherical microphone arrays are desirable because of their ability to capture three-dimensional sound fields, however it is often more practical to construct loudspeaker arrays in the form of a closed circle located in the horizontal plane. This leads to a spatial undersampling as such a circular sampling can only yield a perfect representation of a height-invariant sound field. This paper investigates the consequences of such spatial undersampling by converting between cylindrical and spherical harmonic decompositions of solutions to the wave equation. We show analytically and via numerical simulations that 1) the result of the spatial undersampling is a purely horizontally propagating sound field, and 2) the ratio of travelling and standing components in the undersampled sound field varies depending on the incidence colatitude. The conversion is also used in a beamforming scenario and shows that the beamformer response becomes increasingly omnidirectional as the source moves away from the horizontal plane.},

  abstract = {Expressions are derived for the acoustical impedance of a rectangular enclosure and of a finite annular cylindrical enclosure. The derivation is valid throughout the frequency range in which all dimensions of the enclosure are much less than the wavelength. The results are valid throughout the range from adiabatic to isothermal conditions in the enclosure. The effect is equivalent to placing an additional, frequency-dependent complex impedance in parallel with the adiabatic compliance. As the thermal boundary layer grows to fill the cavity, the reactive part of the impedance varies smoothly from the adiabatic value to the isothermal value. In some microphones, this change in cavity stiffness is sufficient to modify the sensitivity. The resistive part of the additional cavity impedance varies as the inverse square root of frequency at high frequencies where the boundary layer has not grown to fill the enclosure. The thermal modification gives rise to a thermal noise whose spectral density varies asymptotically as  𝑙/ 𝑓 3∕2 𝑙 ∕ 𝑓 3 ∕ 2  above the isothermal transition frequency.},

Here, we present tunable valley phononic crystals (PCs) composed of hybrid channel-cavity cells with three tunable parameters. Our PCs support valley states and Dirac cones with complex wavenumbers. They can be configured to form chirped valley PCs in which edge modes are slowed to zero group velocity states, where the energy at different frequencies accumulates at different designated locations. They enable multiple functionalities, including tuning of dispersion relations for valley states, robust routing of surface acoustic waves, and spatial modulation of group velocities. This work may spark future investigations of topological states with complex wavenumbers in other classical systems, further study of topological states in graded materials, and the development of acoustic devices.},

  abstract = {Acoustic imaging techniques suffer from the diffraction limit due to the loss of evanescent waves that carry subwavelength information of objects. To overcome the diffraction limit, the evanescent components have to be collected and measured. Most of the existing methods targeting this task rely on expensive detector arrays and inefficient near-field point-by-point scanning. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the realization of a far-field acoustic subwavelength imaging method based on a single stationary detector. Specifically, we utilize a series of masks to structure the detected field, so that the evanescent wave information is encoded into the propagating waves due to spatial frequency convolution between the object and masks. Our study shows that, by combining the principles of computational imaging and metalens, high-quality images of a subwavelength object can be reconstructed in the far field, even in the presence of unwanted scatterers. Our work provides a robust method for far-field acoustic subwavelength imaging, which could bring possibilities for acoustic microscopy and could further be applied to medical ultrasonography, underwater sonar, and ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation.},

Adaptive algorithms designed for linear systems, such as the filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm, may diverge in nonlinear systems with a saturated secondary path and result in limited noise reduction performance. Various nonlinear algorithms with improved stability have been proposed; however, a trade-off between noise reduction performance and computational complexity exists when selecting a satisfactory algorithm. This paper therefore proposes a simple algorithm that can achieve significant noise reduction with low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm adopts the same update equation as the FxLMS algorithm, but uses an intermittent update strategy to avoid unnecessary fluctuations of the weight vector when the output of the control filter lies in the saturation region. Simulation results under different conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

This investigation compares the performance of a circular array mounded on a rigid sphere with that of such an array in free space and mounted on an infinite cylinder, using computer simulations. The examined techniques are delay-and-sum and circular harmonics beamforming, and the results are validated experimentally.},

This article provides a review of the four main methods to convert the (thermo)acoustic power into electricity. First, loudspeakers and linear alternators are discussed in a section on electromagnetic devices. This is followed by sections on piezoelectric transducers, magnetohydrodynamic generators, and bidirectional turbines. Each segment provides a literature review of the given technology for the field of thermoacoustics, focusing on possible configurations, operating characteristics, output performance, and analytical and numerical methods to study the devices. This information is used as an input to discuss the performance and feasibility of each method, and to identify challenges that should be overcome for a more successful implementation in thermoacoustic engines. The work is concluded by a comparison of the four technologies, concentrating on the possible areas of application, the conversion efficiency, maximum electrical power output and more generally the suggested focus for future work in the field.},

Yet, the temporal counterpart of Young’s double-slit experiment—a wave interacting with a double temporal modulation of an interface—remains elusive. Here we report such a time-domain version of the classic Young’s double-slit experiment: a beam of light twice gated in time produces an interference in the frequency spectrum. The ‘time slits’, narrow enough to produce diffraction at optical frequencies, are generated from the optical excitation of a thin film of indium tin oxide near its epsilon-near-zero point. The separation between time slits determines the period of oscillations in the frequency spectrum, whereas the decay of fringe visibility in frequency reveals the shape of the time slits. Surprisingly, many more oscillations are visible than expected from existing theory, implying a rise time that approaches an optical cycle. This result enables the further exploration of time-varying physics, towards the spectral synthesis of waves and applications such as signal processing and neuromorphic computation.},

  abstract = {Long-distance vocal communication by birds and mammals, including humans, is facilitated largely by radiation efficiency from the mouth or beak. Here, this efficiency is defined and quantified. It depends on frequency content of vocalization, mouth opening, head and upper body geometry, and directionality. Each of these factors is described mathematically with a piston-in-a-sphere model. While this model is considered a classic, never before has the high frequency solution been applied in detail to vocalization. Results indicate that frequency content in the 1-50 kHz range can be radiated with nearly 100\% efficiency if a reactance peak in the radiation impedance is utilized with adjustments of head size, mouth opening, and beam direction. Without these adjustments, radiation efficiency is generally below 1\%, especially in human speech where a high fundamental frequency is a disadvantage for intelligibility. Thus, two distinct modes of vocal communication are identified, (1) short range with optimized information transfer and (2) long range with maximum efficiency for release of acoustic power.}

  abstract = {A full scale field measurement of the acoustical insertion loss of plenum windows was carried out in the present investigation. Two identical mock-up test rooms with dimensions the same as those commonly adopted for Hong Kong public housing were built side-by-side next to a busy trunk road. One of them was equipped with plenum windows, while the other with the conventional side-hung casement windows. Four internal room settings were included in this study. Results show that both the room modes and the acoustic modes within the plenum window cavities were affecting significantly the low frequency sound transmission. After correcting for the indoor reverberation/absorption effect, the acoustical benefit achieved by replacing side-hung casement windows with the plenum windows tested in the present study was between 7.1 and 9.5 dBA. By comparing the average equivalent sound pressure levels inside the two test rooms with the traffic noise weighted acoustical benefit, it was found that the changes of receiver room reverberation and acoustic modal effects due to such replacement would result in a reduction of plenum window sound insulation performance by 0.2–1.5 dBA. The insulation is stronger for larger room size with stronger indoor sound absorption.},

Starting from a filter-and-sum beamformer over a superdirective array, synthesized by a stochastic and analytic method, which possesses the maximum directivity that the array may achieve and taking into account the probability density functions of the transducers' characteristics, we introduce a post-synthesis optimization that allows to choose a given system performance, after the investigation of a wide space of realistic possibilities. The a posteriori performance tuning will be referred to as oversteering and is effective only for end-fire array. By comparing the results of the proposed technique with those of the optimum synthesis, it is possible to evaluate the proposed method effectiveness in producing frequency-invariant beam patterns with an end-fire looking direction and a number of interesting trade-offs between directivity and robustness.},

  abstract = {For many engineers and acousticians, the boundary element method (BEM) provides an invaluable tool in the analysis of complex problems. It is particularly well suited for the examination of acoustical problems within large domains. Unsurprisingly, the widespread application of the BEM continues to produce an academic interest in the methodology. New algorithms and techniques are still being proposed, to extend the functionality of the BEM, and to compute the required numerical tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency. However, for a given global error constraint, the actual computational accuracy that is required from the various numerical procedures is not often discussed. Within this context, this paper presents an investigation into the discretisation and computational errors that arise in the BEM for acoustic scattering. First, accurate routines to compute regular, weakly singular, and nearly weakly singular integral kernels are examined. These are then used to illustrate the effect of the requisite boundary discretisation on the global error. The effects of geometric and impedance singularities are also considered. Subsequently, the actual integration accuracy required to maintain a given global error constraint is established. Several regular and irregular scattering examples are investigated, and empirical parameter guidelines are provided.},

The forward simulations are based on a k-space pseudo-spectral time domain solution to coupled first-order acoustic equations for homogeneous or heterogeneous media in one, two, and three dimensions. The simulation functions can additionally be used as a flexible time reversal image reconstruction algorithm for an arbitrarily shaped measurement surface. A one-step image reconstruction algorithm for a planar detector geometry based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is also included. The architecture and use of the toolbox are described, and several novel modeling examples are given. First, the use of data interpolation is shown to considerably improve time reversal reconstructions when the measurement surface has only a sparse array of detector points. Second, by comparison with one-step, FFT-based reconstruction, time reversal is shown to be sufficiently general that it can also be used for finite-sized planar measurement surfaces. Last, the optimization of computational speed is demonstrated through parallel execution using a graphics processing unit.},

  abstract = {A full-wave model for nonlinear ultrasound propagation through a heterogeneous and absorbing medium in an axisymmetric coordinate system is developed. The model equations are solved using a nonstandard or k-space pseudospectral time domain method. Spatial gradients in the axial direction are calculated using the Fourier collocation spectral method, and spatial gradients in the radial direction are calculated using discrete trigonometric transforms. Time integration is performed using a k-space corrected finite difference scheme. This scheme is exact for plane waves propagating linearly in the axial direction in a homogeneous and lossless medium and significantly reduces numerical dispersion in the more general case. The implementation of the model is described, and performance benchmarks are given for a range of grid sizes. The model is validated by comparison with several analytical solutions. This includes one-dimensional absorption and nonlinearity, the pressure field generated by plane-piston and bowl transducers, and the scattering of a plane wave by a sphere. The general utility of the model is then demonstrated by simulating nonlinear transcranial ultrasound using a simplified head model.},

  abstract = {An analytic solution is given for the electromagnetic problem of a lossy dielectric cylinder of infinite length, irradiated by a circularly polarized radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field; the NMR-active components of the field inside the cylinder are projected out by transforming the RF Hamiltonian to the rotating frame and retaining only those terms independent of time; it is noted that the resulting cartesian field components are required to be real. The squared magnitude of the NMR-active fields are then used to calculate the gradient-recalled images of the cylinder, for small tip angles of the magnetization; and the result is shown to predict almost quantitatively the intensity patterns of experimental proton images at 3.0 and 4.0T, in a cylindrical phantom of radius 9.25cm, filled with 0.05M aqueous NaCl. In particular, the artifactual brightening at the center of the recorded image is convincingly reproduced in a simulation, whose underlying model excludes wave propagation along the direction of the cylinder axis. Formation of the artifact is explained in terms of the focussing of the RF magnetic field at the center of the cylinder, as illustrated by contour plots showing the time evolution of the rotating flux. An extended electromagnetic model--having the dielectric cylinder enclosed in a long, shielded volume resonator (e.g., of bird cage type)--is then sketched. The mathematical details appear in Appendix A; and the simulated images are shown to be virtually indistinguishable from those of the simpler original model. The theory of the Q, or quality factor, of the dielectric cylinder--considered itself as a resonant object--is developed for the enclosed cylinder model, where flux containment by the shield permits an unambiguous treatment of both the stored energy and the radiative losses. This is extended to treat the Q of a lossy dielectric sphere without shielding. Further plots of flux contours are given for the sphere, excited at 208 MHz with a uniform circularly polarized field, as well as by a surface coil, and for the enclosed cylinder in the range 140-160 MHz. It is then argued that the center brightening artifacts in magnetic resonance images are due to the underdamped dielectric resonance of the sample, i.e., at Q {$>$}0.5, while the overdamped condition, Q {$<$} 0.5, leads to exclusion of flux from the center, i.e., to the classic skin effect. The term "dielectric resonance" is shown to require careful interpretation for mixed-mode excitation, such as occurs with a surface coil. An extended reciprocity formula for NMR reception, valid for an arbitrary electromagnetic Green's function, is also given in Appendix B.},

A simple method for uniquely parameterizing the well-known Regge symmetries of the 3-j and 6-j symbols makes it possible to systematize the choice of the smallest magnitude binomial sum (which enhances the accuracy of floating point calculations and speeds up exact calculations using large integer routines). Formulas for special cases of the 3-j symbols enable the construction of recursion sequences which are often substantially faster than direct summation, especially for very large angular momentum arguments. For both 3-j and 6-j symbols, recursion offers several advantages over direct summation in exact calculations and for calculating tables.},

The corresponding attenuation coefficients beta varies directly as WM involve an integral of the appropriate radial-distribution function. Using the scaled-particle equations of state and statistical-mechanics theorems, we evaluate WM explicitly as a rational function of the volume fraction W of the fluid of rigid b particles. We obtain betaM = betaO WM with betaO as the uncorrelated value; W3(W) for spheres decreases more rapidly with increasing W than W2 for cylinders, and W2 decreases faster than W1, the result for slabs. We apply the results for cylinders in terms of W2 to the problem of the transparency of the cornea (whose collagen fibers are the scatters), as posed by Maurice. The value W APPROXIMATELY 0.6 GIVES GOOD ACCORD WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF THE Data for the transparency of the normal cornea, and the opacity that results from swelling is accounted for by corresponding smaller values of W. Thus, the normal cornea is modeled as a very densely packed two-dimensional gas, with gas-particle (mechanical) radius about 60\% greater than the fiber (optical) radius.},

Band-pass filtering can improve the SNR, but may create an undesirable pre-response. An iterative procedure is developed to measure impulse responses (IRs) with an improved SNR and a constrained pre-response. First, a quick measurement provides information about the system and ambient noise. A second, longer measurement is then performed, and a suitable band-pass filter is applied to the recorded signal. Experimental results show that the proposed procedure achieves an SNR of 37 dB with a peak pre-response amplitude of {$<$}0.2\% of the IR peak, whereas a conventional technique achieves an SNR of 32 dB with a peak pre-response amplitude of 16\%.},

Three techniques for performing this navigation (simulating HOA playback and listener movement within a virtual loudspeaker array, computing and translating along plane-waves, and re-expanding the soundfield about the listener) are compared through numerical simulations of simple incident soundfields and evaluated in terms of both overall soundfield reconstruction accuracy and predicted localization. Results show that soundfield re-expansion achieves arbitrarily low reconstruction errors (relative to the original expansion) in the vicinity of the listener, whereas errors generated by virtual-HOA and plane-wave techniques necessarily impose additional restrictions on the navigable range. Results also suggest that soundfield re-expansion is the only technique capable of accurately generating high-frequency localization cues for off-center listening positions, although the frequencies and translation distances over which this is possible are strictly limited by the original expansion order.},

The measurements are illustrated through four types of plots (frequency response, polar, contour, and waterfall) and are also given as raw impulse responses. Two sets of directivity metrics are defined and are used to rank the loudspeakers. The first set consists of full and partial directivity indices that isolate sections of the loudspeaker’s radiation pattern (e.g., forward radiation alone) and quantify its directivity over those sections. The second set quantifies the extent to which the loudspeaker exhibits constant directivity. Measurements are taken, in an anechoic chamber, along horizontal and vertical orbits with a (nominal) radius of 1.6 m and an angular resolution of five degrees.},

  abstract = {A set of metrics is presented which quantifies, using measured power spectra, the directivity of a loudspeaker, relative either to the full sphere or to a given hemisphere, plane, or half-plane. The former, called the directivity index (DI), is a commonly-used metric, but is only defined for complete sets of measurements. The latter metrics, called partial directivity indices, extend the definition of the DI to isolate sections of the loudspeaker’s radiation pattern (e.g., forward radiation alone) and quantify its directivity over those sections. In general, all DI spectra are given by the ratio between the on-axis power spectrum and a weighted average of a certain subset of power spectra. For the spherical and hemispherical cases, each weight is proportional to the surface area of the portion of the unit sphere represented by the corresponding measurement, whereas for the planar cases, each weight is proportional to the arc length of the corresponding portion of the unit circle. In this document, the partial directivity indices are defined and the relevant formulae needed to compute them are provided.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for soundfield navigation through estimation of the spherical harmonic coefficients (i.e., the higher-order ambisonics signals) of a soundfield at a position within an array of two or more ambisonics microphones. An existing method based on blind source separation is known to suffer from audible artifacts, while an alternative method, in which a weighted average of the ambisonics signals from each microphone is computed, is shown to necessarily introduce comb-filtering and degrade localization for off-center sources. The proposed method entails computing a regularized least-squares estimate of the soundfield at the listening position using the signals from the nearest microphones, excluding those that are nearer to a source than to the listening position. Simulated frequency responses and predicted localization errors suggest that, for interpolation between a pair of microphones, the proposed method achieves both accurate localization and minimal spectral coloration when the product of angular wavenumber and microphone spacing is less than twice the input expansion order. It is also demonstrated that failure to exclude from the calculation those microphones that are nearer to a source than to the listening position can significantly degrade localization accuracy.},

  abstract = {A spectral algorithm is considered for describing nonlinear generation of an acoustic wave of difference frequency formed as the interaction of two high-intensity pump waves close in frequency. To correctly simulate the full wave spectrum involved in such two-frequency interaction, including formation of shock fronts in the acoustic pressure waveform, it is necessary to retain about several thousand spectral components in the numerical algorithm. This paper proposes a method that enables to significantly reduce this number while maintaining the accuracy of calculating the difference-frequency wave field. The method combines the limitation of the high-frequency part of the spectrum and the combination frequencies located between the spectral components that are multiples of frequencies of the initial pump waves. Examples of the interaction of close frequencies typical for the operation of an underwater parametric array are considered in the approximation of the plane one-dimensional wave propagation. It was shown that the method makes it possible to reduce the number of spectral components included in the nonlinear algorithm by more than 100~times and thereby reduce the number of operations by four orders of magnitude. This makes the algorithms for simulating parametric interactions in ultrasound wave fields feasible, including three-dimensional acoustic beams.},

The boundary condition corresponds to dual-frequency excitation of an existing parametric source used for underwater research. It is shown that the linear field of primary waves has a high directivity with a total beam divergence angle of several degrees; therefore, the nonlinear-diffraction problem is solved numerically in the parabolic approximation. The pump wave field is calculated in the linear approximation; the solutions obtained at each step of the numerical grid along the beam axis are used to calculate nonlinear sources in the equation for a three-dimensional difference-frequency beam. The one- and two-dimensional distributions of the pressure field and the directivity pattern are analyzed for three values of a difference frequency. Numerical solutions obtained with realistic boundary conditions at the source and description of diffraction effects are compared with the known approximate analytical results for the quasilinear approach.},

First, we formulate sound field synthesis as a minimization problem of some norm on the difference between the desired and synthesized sound fields, and then the optimal driving signals are derived by using the spherical wavefunction expansion of the sound fields. This formulation is closely related to the mode-matching method; a major advantage of the proposed method is the optimal weight on the mode determined according to the norm to be minimized instead of the empirical truncation in the mode-matching method. We also provide some examples of norms and their corresponding weights in analytical forms. Both interior and exterior sound field reproduction are considered in the proposed method, and some applications, such as multizone reproduction and interior reproduction with exterior cancellation, are also discussed. Numerical simulation results indicated that higher reproduction accuracy can be achieved by the proposed method than by the current pressure-matching and mode-matching methods.},

The amount of information in such measurements is dependent on the mask geometry, which we propose to optimize using an image reconstruction mean square error (MSE) criterion. We approximate the physics involved to define a linear measurement model, which we use to find an expression for the image error covariance matrix. By discretizing the mask surface and defining a discrete number of mask thickness levels per point on its surface, we show how finding the best mask can be posed as a variation of a sensor selection problem. We propose a convex relaxation in combination with randomized rounding, as well as a greedy optimization algorithm to solve this problem. We show empirically that both algorithms come close to the global optimum. Our simulations further show that the optimized masks have better a MSE than nearly all randomly shaped masks. We observe that an optimized mask amplifies echoes coming from within the region of interest (ROI), and strongly reduces the correlation between echoes of pixels within the ROI.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a distributed adaptive algorithm for node-specific sound zoning in a wireless acoustic sensor and actuator network (WASAN), based on a network-wide acoustic contrast control (ACC) method. The goal of the ACC method is to simultaneously create node-specific zones with high signal power (bright zones) while minimizing power leakage in other node-specific zones (dark zones). To obtain this, a network-wide objective involving the acoustic coupling between all the loudspeakers and microphones in the WASAN is proposed where the optimal solution is based on a centralized generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD). To allow for distributed processing, a gradient based GEVD algorithm is first proposed that minimizes the same objective. This algorithm can then be modified to allow for a fully distributed implementation, involving in-network summations and simple local processing. The algorithm is referred to as the distributed adaptive gradient based ACC algorithm (DAGACC). The proposed algorithm outperforms the non-cooperative distributed solution after only a few iterations and converges to the centralized solution, as illustrated by computer simulations.},

  abstract = {Near-field acoustic source localization and beamforming has hitherto not been investigated extensively in the spherical harmonic domain under reverberant conditions. In this paper, a novel method for the near-field direction of arrival (DOA) and range estimation using signal invariant and direction independent spherical harmonic features is proposed. A spatial pressure interpolation method that effectively captures the acoustic energy on the surface of the sphere is first developed in the spherical harmonic domain. Near-field DOA estimates are then computed using this pressure distribution. Spherical harmonic features that are signal invariant and direction independent are then extracted using the near field DOA estimates. Signal invariant features are obtained by normalizing spherical harmonic coefficients with a component that is proportional to the source signal strength. Direction independent features are obtained using two methods. Rotation of spherical harmonic functions over a sphere is performed using Wigner-D functions in one method, whereas in the other, the effect of DOA is compensated by spherical harmonic normalization. Using the signal invariant and direction independent features, a learning-based framework which utilizes a convolutional neural network and voicing activity detection is also developed to compute the range of the near-field source. Experiments are conducted both on simulated and real speech data for evaluating the performance of the proposed spherical harmonic features in the context of near-field localization as well as beamforming. Root mean square error of both near-field DOA and source range estimates are obtained. Objective evaluation of near-field beamformed acoustic outputs is also performed. Results obtained are motivating enough for the method to be used in practical near-field beamforming applications.},

Here, experimental characterization of high intensity progressive and divergent sound beams in air at 300\,kHz are presented. Measurements in this frequency range are challenging. Accurate characterization of high intensity sound beams requires a measurement bandwidth at least ten times the beam's primary frequency, as high intensity soundwaves steepen and form shocks and, therefore, contain significant signal power at harmonic frequencies. Hence, a measurement bandwidth of at least 3\,MHz is required. Calibrated measurement microphones are generally not available in this frequency range. This limitation has been overcome by using a hydrophone with a calibrated response from 250\,kHz to 20\,MHz. A narrowband piezoelectric transducer is used as the source in this study, and it is capable of generating tone burst waveforms centered at 300\,kHz with 160\,dB sound pressure level surface pressure. Cumulative wave steepening and shock formation are observed in on-axis measurements. The source's surface vibration profile is measured using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, and the vibration profile is imported into a numerical wide-angle Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov simulation for comparison against measured on-axis waveforms.},

A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the occurrence of nonlinear, irregular shock reflections at the ground. Propagation angle, source location, and corresponding angle of incidence relative to the ground are estimated using a two-point cross correlation of windowed shock events. Nonlinear reflections are likely to occur based on the combination of angles of incidence and measured shock strengths and cause a pressure increase at the shock that is greater than twice the free-field pressure. The associated pressure increase at the shocks appears to enhance shock-related metrics at the ground compared to off-ground locations.},

  abstract = {Capturing the impulse or frequency response functions within extended regions of a room requires an unfeasible number of measurements. In this study, a method to reconstruct the response at arbitrary points based on compressive sensing (CS) is examined. The sound field is expanded into plane waves and their amplitudes are estimated via CS, obtaining a spatially sparse representation of the sound field. The validity of the CS assumptions are discussed, namely, the assumption of the wave field spatial sparsity (which depends strongly on the properties of the specific room), and the coherence of the sensing matrix due to different spatial sampling schemes. An experimental study is presented in order to analyze the accuracy of the reconstruction. Measurements with a scanning robotic arm make it possible to circumvent uncertainty due to positioning and transducer mismatch, and examine the accuracy of the reconstruction over extended regions of space. The results indicate that near perfect reconstructions are possible at low frequencies, even from a limited set of measurements. In addition, the study shows that it is possible to reconstruct damped room responses with reasonable accuracy well into the mid-frequency range.},

  abstract = {Acousto-optic sensing is based on the interaction between sound and light: pressure waves induce density variations, which, in turn, alter the way light propagates in air. Pressure fields are, thus, characterized by measuring changes in light propagation induced by pressure waves. Although acousto-optic sensing provides a way of acquiring acoustic information noninvasively, its widespread application has been hindered by the use of reconstruction methods ill-suited for representing acoustic fields. In this study, an acousto-optic holography method is proposed in which the sound pressure in the near field of a source is captured via acousto-optic sensing. The acousto-optic measurements are expanded into propagating and evanescent waves, as in near-field acoustic holography, making it possible to completely characterize the radiated field noninvasively. An algebraic formulation of the wave expansion enables the use of arbitrary sets of projections. The proposed method is demonstrated experimentally by capturing the acoustic field radiated by a vibrating plate. Accurate holographic reconstructions of the pressure, particle velocity, and intensity fields are obtained using purely optical data. These results are particularly significant for the study of sound fields at mid and high frequencies, where using conventional transducers could perturb the measured field and spatial sampling requirements are challenging.},

Parallel processing in the receive mode produces 4992 scan lines at a rate of approximately B frames/second. Echo data for the scanned volume is presented as projection images with depth perspective, stereoscopic pairs, multiple tomographic images, or C-mode scans.},

  abstract = {Emerging sonography techniques often require increasing the number of transducer elements involved in the imaging process. Consequently, larger amounts of data must be acquired and processed. The significant growth in the amounts of data affects both machinery size and power consumption. Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems reduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected signals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate reduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite Rate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which combines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in Compressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual transducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is limited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous parameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the low-rate samples. In our work, we achieve SNR enhancement, by beamforming the sub-Nyquist samples obtained from multiple elements. We refer to this process as “compressed beamforming”. Applying it to cardiac ultrasound data, we successfully image macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly eightfold reduction in sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.},

No simplifying assumptions are made other than bandlimitation. This reduces typical computation times for convolving the full sky with the asymmetric beam pattern of a megapixel Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) mission from months to minutes. Our methods enable realistic simulation and careful analysis of data from such missions, taking into account the effects of asymmetric ``point spread functions'' and far side lobes of the physical beam. While motivated by CMB studies, our methods are general and hence applicable to the convolution or filtering of any scalar field on the sphere with an arbitrary, asymmetric kernel. We show in an appendix that the same ideas can be applied to the inverse problems of map-making and beam reconstruction by similarly accelerating the \{\textbackslash em transpose convolution\} which is needed for the iterative solution of the normal equations.},

Objective analyses have been run for nine source/receiver combinations in a simple hall on three acoustic parameters: relative sound pressure level (SPL), reverberation time (T30), and clarity index (C80). Auralizations were subsequently created for two source/receiver combinations and used in subjective testing with 28 subjects. Results show that, objectively, differences in SPL were negligible for the majority of cases. Some differences in T30 and C80 were found between the omni-directional and realistically-directional sources; however, subjects did not perceive any corresponding differences when comparing the auralizations, possibly due to the limited directional octave band data available. Subjects did significantly differentiate between auralizations from the omni-directional source and the extreme beaming source. Subjective results from comparing these two sources in terms of reverberation, clarity and realism were generally consistent with objective data, although source/receiver combination and musical track had some influence on the outcomes.},

  abstract = {The core-shell nanoparticle structure, which consists of an inner layer "guest" nanoparticle encapsulated inside another of a different material, is the simplest motif in two-component systems. In comparison to the conventional single-component systems, complex systems pose both challenges and opportunities. In this Account, we describe our recent progresses in using core-shell motif for exploring new and sophisticated nanostructures. Our discussion is focused on the mechanistic details, in order to facilitate rational design in future studies. We believe that systematic development of synthetic capability, particularly in complex and multifunctional systems, is of great importance for future applications. A key issue in obtaining core-shell nanostructures is minimizing the core-shell interfacial tension. Typically, one can coat the core with a ligand for better interaction with the shell. By selecting suitable ligands, we have developed general encapsulation methods in three systems. A variety of nanoparticles and nanowires were encapsulated using either amphiphilic block copolymer (polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid)), conductive polymer (polyaniline, polypyrrole, or polythiophene), or silica as the shell material. Obvious uses of shells are to stabilize colloidal objects, retain their surface ligands, prevent particle aggregation, or preserve the assembled superstructures. These simple capabilities are essential in our synthesis of surface-enhanced Raman scattering nanoprobes, in assigning the solution state of nanostructures before drying, and in developing purification methods for nano-objects. When it is applied in situ during nanocrystal growth or nanoparticle assembly, the intermediates trapped by shell encapsulation can offer great insights into the mechanistic details. On the other hand, having a shell as a second component provides a window for exploring the core-shell synergistic effects. Hybrid core-shell nanocrystals have interesting effects, for example, in causing the untwisting of nanowires to give double helices. In addition, partial polymer shells can bias nanocrystal growth towards one direction or promote the random growth of Au dendritic structures; contracting polymer shells can compress the embedded nanofilaments (Au nanowires or carbon nanotubes), forcing them to coil into rings. Also, by exploiting the sphere-to-cylinder conversion of block copolymer micelles, the Au nanoparticles pre-embedded in the polymer micelles can be assembled into long chains. Lastly, shells are also very useful for mechanistic studies. We have demonstrated such applications in studying the controlled aggregation of nanoparticles, in probing the diffusion kinetics of model drug molecules from nanocarriers to nanoacceptors, and in measuring the ionic diffusion through polyaniline shells.}

Such a beam can be easily generated using a spatially incoherent, annular source. Moreover, the direction of maximal scattering can be shifted by changing the spatial coherence length. In this process, the total power that is scattered remains constant. This new tool to control scattering directionality may be used to steer the scattered field away from the forward direction and selectively address detectors situated at different angles.}

This type of transducers also provides a mechanism to generate tilted wavefronts in acousto-optic deflectors to deflect laser beams for high precision advanced laser material processing. In this paper, a theoretical model is presented for the diffraction of ultrasonic waves emitted by several phased array transducers into an acousto-optic medium such as TeO2 crystal. A simple analytic expression is obtained for the distribution of the ultrasonic displacement field in the crystal. The model prediction is found to be in good agreement with the results of a numerical model that is based on a non-paraxial multi-Gaussian beam (NMGB) model.},

In this work, we propose to utilize machine learning algorithms, specifically support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), for solving combinatorial antenna selection problems. Numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning algorithms for sparse array design. Moreover, the SVM based antenna selection is robust against DOA estimate uncertainties.},

Specifically, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a non-Hermitian acoustic metasurface mirror featuring extremely asymmetrical reflection at the exception point. As an example, the metasurface mirror is designed to have high-efficiency retroreflection when the wave comes from one side and near-perfect absorption when the wave comes from the opposite side. This work marries conventional gradient index metasurfaces with the exceptional point from non-Hermitian systems, and it paves the way for identifying new mechanisms and functionalities for wave manipulation.},

  abstract = {In many standard acoustic tests, the sound field in a reverberation room is required to be sufficiently diffuse. The standard deviation of sound pressure levels is commonly used to evaluate the spatial uniformity of a sound field; however, this paper shows that the standard deviation of squared sound pressures is a better indicator of sound field diffusivity at frequencies below 100~Hz where the sound field is very uneven. Fixed diffusers are recommended in ISO 354 to improve sound field diffusivity in reverberation rooms, and performing sound absorption measurements with an increasing number of diffusers is employed as a check on the diffusivity of the sound field above 500~Hz. This paper demonstrates that typical panel diffusers (as suggested in ISO 354) cannot increase the sound field diffusivity at low frequencies. While low frequency diffusivity can be improved with large panels at some frequencies, the diffusivity at other frequencies generally deteriorates. Experimental results in a reverberation room are presented to support the numerical simulation results and analyses.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an analytical expression of the acoustic radiation force (ARF) for a spherical particle with a hemispherically split impedance boundary in a plane wave is deduced. Numerical calculations are carried out by considering the effect of the magnitude and phase of the acoustic impedance on the ARF. Computation results show that the increase in the magnitude of the acoustic impedance results in an overall decrease in the ARF, whereas the phase of the acoustic impedance results in a decrease in the ARF in the low frequency region. As the frequency increases, the positive phase angle leads to a decrease in the ARF, and the negative phase angle causes the ARF to increase rapidly. For a hemispherically split impedance sphere, the values of the ARF range from those of the rigid sphere and uniform impedance sphere. The finite-element models for the calculation of the ARF of a hemispherically split impedance boundary sphere are established and the correctness of the analytical theory is proved by numerical comparison. This work is expected to contribute theoretical support to the acoustic manipulation of particles with a nonuniform hemispherically split structure.},

Such RSFs are not only spatially disordered but also temporally scrambled. Although the spatial control of steady-state RSFs at single frequencies is successfully achieved by extending the idea of wavefront shaping to acoustics, time-coherent polychromatic control of RSFs has remained out of reach. Here, we report spatiotemporal acoustic wavefield shaping by adaptively reshaping acoustic impulse responses at arbitrary positions and different instants in a reverberating room using spatial sound modulators—a reconfigurable and programmable membrane-type acoustic metasurface capable of encoding desirable phase factors over a finite bandwidth. We further analyze the mechanism and performance of spatiotemporal wavefield shaping with a simple numerical model derived from multiple scattering in the time domain. Our results expand the capabilities of RSF control to the temporal domain and demonstrate the possibilities for transient engineering of polychromatic sound in acoustic communication, imaging, and holography.},

Rotational Doppler effect provides an intuitive paradigm to shifting the frequency in a linear system which, however, needs a spiral-phase change upon the wave propagation. Here a rotating passive linear vortex metasurface is numerically and experimentally presented with close-to-unity mode purity ({$>$}93\%) and high conversion efficiency ({$>$}65\%) in audible sound frequency as low as 3000 Hz. The topological charge of the transmitted sound is almost immune from the rotational speed and transmissivity, demonstrating the mechanical robustness and stability in adjusting the high-performance frequency conversion in situ. These features enable the researchers to cascade multiple vortex metasurfaces to further enlarge and diversify the extent of sound frequency conversion, which are experimentally verified. This strategy takes a step further toward the freewheeling sound manipulation at acoustic frequency domain, and may have far-researching impacts in various acoustic communications, signal processing, and contactless detection.},

In this Letter, we report the discovery of a generic non-Hermitian phenomenon that we call an “extended state in a localized continuum” (ELC). As the name suggests, the ELC is the inversion of the BIC—a single extended state embedded in a continuous spectrum entirely consisting of localized modes, and its emergence rests in the interplay between the BIC and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Herein, the BIC is a zero-energy corner mode that spectrally overlaps with a bulk band in a Hermitian kagome lattice. The ELC emerges with the introduction of the NHSE in a particular way, such that it turns all the bulk states into corner skin modes and simultaneously delocalizes the corner mode. We experimentally realize the ELC using an active mechanical lattice. Our findings not only demonstrate the rich potential of the NHSE but may also spark new wave-based applications.}

It is generally implemented with a uniform circular array (UCA). Here, an implementation method of continuously steerable SCBPs is proposed for a projector array. The synthesis and the implementation of the continuously steerable SCBP are studied and analyzed based on a UCA model composed of omnidirectional sources. An improved version of the common method is proposed. It requires fewer array elements and the massive power amplifiers matched to each array element, which reduces the cost and the installation space. Subsequently, a continuously steerable SCBP is implemented with a uniform circular projector array (UCPA). This system is composed of single-sided radiation flextensional transducers and is studied and analyzed with a finite element method, which verified that the proposed method is suitable for the underwater acoustic projector array. Finally, UCPA prototypes were fabricated. The tests demonstrated that the proposed implementation method is a flexible way for the application of the continuously steerable SCBP in the low-frequency emission field.},

Targeting to enhance the control flexibility, this paper proposes an efficient, fully FPGA-based PAL system to provide multiple low-distortion audio signals of different contents to separate directions from a single PAL device.

Recent studies of non-Hermitian band theories unveiled the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), by which the bulk states collapse to the boundary as skin modes3–6. Here we explore the NHSE to reshape the wavefunctions of TMs by delocalizing them from the boundary. At a critical non-Hermitian parameter, the in-gap TMs even become completely extended in the entire bulk lattice, forming an ‘extended mode outside of a continuum’. These extended modes are still protected by bulk-band topology, making them robust against local disorders. The morphing of TM wavefunction is experimentally realized in active mechanical lattices in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional topological lattices, as well as in a higher-order topological lattice. Furthermore, by the judicious engineering of the non-Hermiticity distribution, the TMs can deform into a diversity of shapes. Our findings not only broaden and deepen the current understanding of the TMs and the NHSE but also open new grounds for topological applications.},

The NHSE is a topological effect owing to the non-trivial spectral winding, and such spectral behaviors appear naturally in non-reciprocal systems. Hence prevailing approaches rely on non-reciprocity to achieve the NHSE. Here, we report the experimental realization of the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE) in a two-dimensional (2D) reciprocal system, in which the skin effect occurs only at boundaries whose macroscopic symmetry mismatches with the lattice symmetry. The role of spectral reciprocity and symmetry is revealed by connecting reflective channels at given boundaries with the spectral topology of the PBC spectrum. Our work highlights the vital role of reciprocity and macroscopic geometry on the NHSE in systems with dimensions larger than one and opens new routes for wave structuring using non-Hermitian effects.},

Our experimental results accord well with Lord Rayleigh’s theory concerning how thin viscous and thermal boundary layers at a slit’s walls affect the acoustic wave across the whole slit cavity. By measuring accurately the frequencies of the Fabry-Perot-like cavity resonances, we find a significant 5\% reduction in the effective speed of sound through the slits when an individual viscous boundary layer occupies only 5\% of the total slit width. Importantly, this effect is true for any airborne slit cavity, with the reduction being achieved despite the slit width being on a far larger scale than an individual boundary layer’s thickness. This work demonstrates that the recent prevalent loss-free treatment of narrow slit cavities within acoustic metamaterials is unrealistic.},

  abstract = {Recent progress reported from different groups have shown that 3-D ultrasonic imaging is possible using electronic beam steering with 2-D matrix arrays having rare and random array patterns. In simulation studies Turnbull et al (1990) have shown that reducing the number of elements of a 2D matrix array down to order 8 keeps resolution and leads still to sufficient contrast. These random arrays are usually obtained by generating a random pattern with the desired numbers of elements. We have investigated main to side lobe levels of random sparse arrays and found substantial differences in side lobe levels in different random patterns containing the same element number. Based on this finding an optimization process has been developed which generates optimized array patterns for a given matrix array and fixed order of reduction using a genetic algorithm. Almost independent from the initial array pattern the optimized pattern is obtained after 400 iteration steps. The function to be minimized is the difference between the radiation pattern of the random array and the fully sampled λ/2 array. The radiation power irradiated outside the main lobe is approximate four times lower compared to the unoptimized array},

Advances in metasurfaces have led to various practical applications ranging from lensing to holography. Metasurface holograms that can be switched by the polarization state of incident light have been demonstrated for achieving polarization multiplexed functionalities. However, practical application of these devices has been limited by their capability for achieving high efficiency and high image quality. Here we experimentally demonstrate a helicity multiplexed metasurface hologram with high efficiency and good image fidelity over a broad range of frequencies. The metasurface hologram features the combination of two sets of hologram patterns operating with opposite incident helicities. Two symmetrically distributed off-axis images are interchangeable by controlling the helicity of the input light. The demonstrated helicity multiplexed metasurface hologram with its high performance opens avenues for future applications with functionality switchable optical devices.},

Here, we demonstrate the amplifying diode using an active metamaterial with nonreciprocal Willis coupling. We also discuss the situation with the presence of both reciprocal and nonreciprocal Willis couplings for more flexibility in implementation. The coexistence of both amplifier and perfect absorber in opposite incident directions extends the regime of sound isolation and further enables applications in sensing and communication, in which nonreciprocity can play an important role.},

  institution = {{University of Music and Performing Arts Graz}},
  abstract = {The perception of sound in rooms is influenced by the room acoustics. Depending on geometrical properties and texture of the room, a direct sound is followed by multiple reflections. For standard surrounding audio reproduction systems, the influence of reflections on the perception is well studied. Recent developments allow more particular constellations and compact loudspeaker arrays with highly pronounced variable directivity patterns that excite wall reflections from a single point in the room to spatialize auditory events. However, their prediction in space mostly fails when standard localization models are used. This is because the underlying psychoacoustic principles are different from those known for standard spatialization systems. This doctoral thesis investigates perceptions elicited by the sound field of a directional sound source in a room. Starting from auditory events evoked by a few precisely controlled sound instances examined in the laboratory, the aim of this work is to understand what perceptions are formed by the interaction of direct sound and its reflections. This bottom-up approach allows the development of models of perception building upon the measurements from the different stages of experimental complexity.},

Recently-emerged deep learning technique achieved great success in interpreting wave field such as in ultrasound non-destructive testing and disease diagnosis, but conventionally need time-consuming computer postprocessing or bulky-sized diffractive elements. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely-passive and small-footprint meta-neural-network for real-time recognizing complicated objects by analyzing acoustic scattering. We prove meta-neural-network mimics a standard neural network despite its compactness, thanks to unique capability of its metamaterial unit-cells (dubbed meta-neurons) to produce deep-subwavelength phase shift as training parameters. The resulting device exhibits the “intelligence” to perform desired tasks with potential to overcome the current limitations, showcased by two distinctive examples of handwritten digit recognition and discerning misaligned orbital-angular-momentum vortices. Our mechanism opens the route to new metamaterial-based deep-learning paradigms and enable conceptual devices automatically analyzing signals, with far-reaching implications for acoustics and related fields.},

Ground states and excited systems can both be treated with this formalism, although the latter involves a significantly more difficult analysis. Also, a useful dispersion relation is obtained for the response function. Then, an accurate method is presented for evaluating bound state and continuum single-particle wave functions in momentum space, the representation in which one most naturally derives the appropriate single-particle normalization factors. However, it is argued that for calculating folding integrals of two singleparticle wave functions coordinate space may be superior to momentum space. Our main results show that for any reasonable description of light nuclei excited by pions, the continuum states must be included. Also, in these systems the overall response of the continuum states is dramatically dependent on the real part of the Δ-particle optical potential.},

  abstract = {Isolators, devices with unidirectional wave transmission, are integral components in computing networks, enabling a one-way division of a large system into independent subunits. Isolators are created by breaking the inversion symmetry between a source and a receiver, known as reciprocity. In acoustics, a steady flow of the background medium in which sound travels can break reciprocity, but significant isolation is typically achieved only for large, often impractical speeds. This article proposes acoustic isolator designs enabled by duct flow that do not require large flow velocities. A basic isolator design is simulated based on the acoustic analogue of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with monomodal entry and exit ports. The simulated device footprint is then reduced by using bimodal ports. Further, a nonuniform velocity profile combined with a grating to induce phononic transitions is considered, which, combined with filters, can provide significant isolation. By coupling a waveguide with flow to free space through an array of small apertures, largely nonreciprocal leaky-wave radiation is demonstrated, breaking the symmetry between reception and transmission patterns of an acoustic linear aperture array. These investigations open interesting pathways towards efficient acoustic isolation, which may be translated into integrated acoustic and surface acoustic waves, as well as phononic technology.},

  abstract = {Advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) technology are promising for the creation of acoustic materials. Acoustic metamaterials and metasurfaces are of particular interest for the application of AM technologies as theoretical predictions suggest the need for precise arrangements of dissimilar materials within specified regions of space to reflect, transmit, guide, or absorb acoustic waves in ways that exceed the capabilities of currently available acoustic materials. This work presents the design of an acoustic metasurface (AMS) with Willis constitutive behavior, which is created from an array of multi-material inclusions embedded in an elastomeric matrix, which displays the asymmetric acoustic absorption. The finite element models of the AMS show that the asymmetric absorption is dependent on asymmetry in the distribution of materials within the inclusion and highly sensitive to small changes in the inclusion geometry. It is shown that the performance variability can be used to place constraints on the manufacturing-induced variability to ensure that an as-built AMS will perform using the as-designed parameters. The evaluation of the AMS performance is computationally expensive, thus, the design is performed with a classifier-based metamodel to support more efficient Monte Carlo simulations and quantify the sensitivity of the candidate design performance to the manufacturing variability. This work explores combinations of material choices and dimensional accuracies to demonstrate how a robust design approach can be used to help select AM fabrication methods or guide process development toward an AM process that is capable of fabricating acoustic material structures.},

  abstract = {A technique is described to image the vector intensity in the near field of a spherical array of microphones flush mounted in a rigid sphere. The spatially measured pressure is decomposed into Fourier harmonics in order to reconstruct the volumetric vector intensity outside the sphere. The theory for this reconstruction is developed in this paper. The resulting intensity images are very successful at locating and quantifying unknown exterior acoustic sources, ideal for application in noise control problems in interior spaces such as automobiles and airplanes. Arrays of varying numbers of microphones and radii are considered and compared and errors are computed for both theory and experiment. It is demonstrated that this is an ill-posed problem below a cutoff frequency depending on array design, requiring Tikhonov regularization below cutoff. There is no low frequency limit on operation, although the signal-to-noise ratio is the determining factor for high-spatial resolution at low frequencies. It is shown that the upper frequency limit is set by the number of microphones in the array and is independent of noise. The accuracy of the approach is assessed by considering the exact solution for the scattering of a point source by a rigid sphere. Several field experiments are presented to demonstrate the utility of the technique. In these experiments, the partial field decomposition technique is used and holograms of multiple exterior sources are separated and their individual volumetric intensity fields imaged. In this manner, the intensity fields of two uncorrelated tube sources in an anechoic chamber are isolated from one another and separated intensity maps are obtained from over a broad frequency range. In a practical application, the vector intensity field in the interior of an automobile cabin is mapped at the fundamental of the engine vibration using the rigid sphere positioned at the driver’s head. The source regions contributing to the interior cabin noise are identified.},

The endcaps as well as the cylindrical surface have a specified modal vibration pattern, and the problem is solved using the sum of two independent formulations based on the Fourier transform: (1) a vibrating cylinder with rigid endcaps and (2) a rigid cylindrical tube with vibrating diaphragms at its ends. The resulting nearfield solution correctly models the diffraction effects generated at the sharp ends of the cylinder. Calculation of the farfield radiated pressure follows directly from the nearfield solutions with a slight modification to the standard formulas. Results from the formulations are validated with a boundary element simulation and show excellent agreement with errors of less than 1\%.},

  abstract = {Some new variational principles for elastodynamic problems, which reduce to the Hashin-Shtrikman principle in the static limit, are presented. They are deduced from dynamical analogues of the classical energy principles of elastostatics by performing appropriate rearrangements and then neglecting certain terms that are quadratic in a measure of the error associated with the approximating trial fields. One of the new principles is then employed to develop equations that provide an approximate description of waves in a random composite. These equations make optimal use of the pair correlations of the composite, in the sense that better approximation (relative to the variational principle) would unavoidably involve correlations of higher order.},

  abstract = {Accurately representing acoustic source distributions is an important part of ultrasound simulation. This is challenging for grid-based collocation methods when such distributions do not coincide with the grid points, for instance when the source is a curved, two-dimensional surface embedded in a three-dimensional domain. Typically, grid points close to the source surface are defined as source points, but this can result in “staircasing” and substantial errors in the resulting acoustic fields. This paper describes a technique for accurately representing arbitrary source distributions within Fourier collocation methods. The method works by applying a discrete, band-limiting convolution operator to the continuous source distribution, after which source grid weights can be generated. This allows arbitrarily shaped sources, for example, focused bowls and circular pistons, to be defined on the grid without staircasing errors. The technique is examined through simulations of a range of ultrasound sources, and comparisons with analytical solutions show excellent accuracy and convergence rates. Extensions of the technique are also discussed, including application to initial value problems, distributed sensors, and moving sources.},

In this work, relaxor ferroelectric PMN-0.28PT single crystal with very high piezoelectric constant d33~≥~2000 pC/N and electromechanical coupling coefficient k33~∼~0.92 is used to fabricate high-frequency phased array transducers. A 128-element 20-MHz phased array transducer is successfully fabricated, and the optimized performance of −6 dB average bandwidth of~∼~84~\% and insertion loss of −43~dB are achieved. The axial and lateral imaging resolutions of the transducer are determined to be 81~µm and 243~µm, respectively. With Verasonics image platform, in vivo fisheye images are acquired, demonstrating the potential application of our developed high-frequency phased array transducer for biomedical research on small animals.},

  abstract = {Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) is mostly performed using a passive noise barrier, vibration actuators, sensors and a control system. ASAC reduces or alters the vibration of the barrier structure in a way that blocks the noise propagation through it. However, it is crucial that the actuators are appropriately arranged to be able to effectively control the vibration of the barrier. If the actuators were not optimally arranged, then certain modes of the structure may be uncontrollable, or require a very high control effort. Hence, the locations of the actuators should be determined by a careful optimization process employing a model of the structure. A common approach is to maximize the controllability of the system over a defined frequency range of operation. However, such an optimisation procedure often results in a solution that considers numerous vibration modes, only some of which are acoustically-relevant. That is, certain structural modes may vibrate considerably, but their contribution to the noise transmission and radiation would be negligible. Therefore, in the presented research a new acoustic radiation-based approach to the optimisation of the arrangement of actuators is proposed. A model of acoustic radiation is introduced and new cost functions are formulated to focus on modes that strongly contribute to noise transmission or radiation by the noise barrier. For the considered system, this enables an increase in the controllability measure of more than 5\,dB for acoustically-relevant modes, which is similar to the level of improvement achieved when the number of actuators is doubled.},

  abstract = {The numerically implemented angular spectrum approach (ASA) is investigated based on the evaluation of the 2‐D fields radiated by striplike planar sources and 1‐D focusing linear‐phased arrays with different aperture sizes and on the comparison with those obtained by using the analytical solution derived with the point spread function method. Since the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a finite‐size source produces an angular spectrum with spatial frequency aliasing and discretization of the source in even‐numbered samples causes a half‐sample length phase shift error in the angular spectrum, the effects of the aliasing and the phase shift on calculation accuracy are dealt with. The results show that the frequency aliasing causes an overestimation of the near field and the phase shift distorts the results. A numerical algorithm for eliminating the aliasing is proposed and correction of the phase shift is confirmed to be necessary. The algorithm proposed can completely remove the errors and obtain exact results. The methods used in this paper can be directly applied to the case of 3‐D fields. The investigation of the characteristics of the numerically implemented ASA as a function of angular range is carried out in the companion paper [P. Wu, R. Kazys, and T.

  abstract = {A solid state magnetic resonance imaging technique is used to measure true three-dimensional mineral density of synthetic hydroxyapatite phantoms and specimens of bone ex vivo. The phosphorus-31 free induction decay at 2.0 T magnetic field strength is sampled following application of a short, hard radiofrequency excitation pulse in the presence of a fixed amplitude magnetic field gradient. Multiple gradient directions covering the unit sphere are used in an efficient spherical polar to Cartesian interpolation and Fourier transform projection reconstruction scheme to image the three-dimensional distribution of phosphorus within the specimen. Using 3-6 Gauss/cm magnetic field gradients, a spatial resolution of 0.2 cm over a field of view of 10 cm is achieved in an imaging time of 20-35 minutes. Comparison of solid state magnetic resonance imaging with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), gravimetric analysis, and chemical analysis of calcium and phosphorus demonstrates good quantitative accuracy. Direct measurement of bone mineral by solid state magnetic resonance opens up the possibility of imaging variations in mineral composition as well as density. Advantages of the solid state magnetic resonance technique include avoidance of ionizing radiation; direct measurement of a constituent of the mineral without reliance on assumptions about, or models of, tissue composition; the absence of shielding, beam hardening, or multiple scattering artifacts; and its three-dimensional character. Disadvantages include longer measurement times and lower spatial resolution than DXA and computed tomography, and the inability to scan large areas of the body in a single measurement, although spatial resolution is sufficient to resolve cortical from trabecular bone for the purpose of measuring bone mineral density.},

A common approach is to use an array of loudspeakers to reproduce the desired field where the least-squares method is used to calculate the loudspeaker weights. However, the least-squares method involves matrix inversion which may lead to errors if the matrix is poorly conditioned. In this paper, we use the concept of theoretical continuous loudspeaker on a circle to derive the discrete loudspeaker aperture functions by avoiding matrix inversion. In addition, the aperture function obtained through continuous loudspeaker method reveals the underlying structure of the solution as a function of the desired soundfield, the loudspeaker positions, and the frequency. This concept can also be applied for the 3-D soundfield reproduction using spherical harmonics analysis with a spherical array. Results are verified through computer simulations.},

In this paper, we provide a framework to recreate 2-D spatial multizone soundfields using a single array of loudspeakers which encompasses all spatial regions of interest. The reproduction is based on the derivation of an equivalent global soundfield consisting of a number of individual multizone soundfields. This is achieved by using spatial harmonic coefficients translation between coordinate systems. A multizone soundfield reproduction problem is then reduced to the reproduction over the entire region. An important advantage of this approach is the full use of the available dimensionality of the soundfield. This paper provides quantitative performances of a 2-D multizone system and reveals some fundamental limits on 2-D multizone soundfield reproduction. The extensions of the multizone soundfield reproduction design in reverberant rooms are also included.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a straightforward approach is presented to generate Bessel beam sources in three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Based on the angular spectrum representation (ASR), the incident Bessel beam is described as a superposition of plane waves whose wavevectors covering a conical surface. This decomposition of Bessel beam is then approximated by a finite collection of plane waves, which are injected into FDTD simulation domain using the total-field/scattered-field (TF/ST) method. The present method's correctness and accuracy are verified by comparing the reconstructed field in FDTD with the original field. Far-field scattered diagrams of a dielectric sphere and a spheroid particle illuminated by a zero-order or a higher-order Bessel beam are calculated using FDTD. The results are compared with those calculated using the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT) and surface integral equation method (SIEM). Very good agreements have been achieved, which partially indicate the correctness of our method. Internal and near-surface field distributions for a two-layer hemisphere particle, which are illuminated by Bessel beams, are also displayed to show the potentials of this approach in solving scattering problems of complex particles. This approach can also be applied to generate other structured beam sources in FDTD, which provides an access to solve structured beam scattering by complex particles using FDTD.}

  abstract = {The medical community has expressed significant interest in the treatment of cartilage defect. Successful repair of articular cartilage defects remains a challenge in clinics. Due to the huge advantages of 3D micro/nanomaterials, 3D artificial micro/nano scaffolds have been widely developed and explored in the tissue repair of articular joints. In this study, chondrocyte/osteoblast-loaded beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) bioceramic scaffold and chondrocyte-loaded beta-TCP bioceramic scaffold were prepared by micromass stem cell culture and bioreactor-based cells-loaded scaffold culture for articular cartilage defect treatment. The results demonstrate chondrocyte and osteoblast can be successfully induced from allogeneic bone marrow stromal cells using micromass stem cell culture. Further, chondrocyte-loaded beta-TCP scaffold and osteoblast-loaded beta-TCP scaffold can be successfully prepared by bioreactor-based cells-loaded scaffold culture. Finally, the scaffolds are applied for Beagle articular cartilage defect treatment. The relative cartilage regeneration abilities on Beagle femoral trochleae were as follows: Chondrocyte/osteoblast-loaded beta-TCP bioceramic scaffold group {$>$} chondrocyte-loaded beta-TCP bioceramic scaffold group {$>$} beta-TCP bioceramic scaffold. Therefore, micromass stem cell culture and bioreactor-based cells-loaded scaffold culture can be applied to prepare chondrocyte/osteoblast-loaded beta-TCP bioceramic scaffold for articular cartilage defect treatment. It suggests allogenic chondrocyte/osteoblast-loaded beta-TCP bioceramic scaffold could be potentially used in the treatment of patients with cartilage defects.}

  abstract = {This paper describes an experimental method for making high resolution measurements of the tonal noise from a UAV propeller in the acoustic near-field and then methods of using this data to predict blade loading, via inversion, and the radiated ‘steady loading’ and ‘thickness’ tones, via extrapolation. The experimental method uses a traversing probe microphone to measure the acoustic pressure along an axial line outboard of the propeller tip. The acoustic pressures were then ensemble averaged over many propeller revolutions. Because of the azimuthal periodicity of the ensemble-average pressure field produced by the propeller, the measured data was used to infer the pressure on a cylinder enclosing the propeller. These measurements are compared with a noise prediction made using data from a computational fluid dynamics simulation of the same propeller and are found to be in reasonable agreement – with differences attributed to the small differences in the predicted and actual blade loading distributions. Because of the high amplitude and evanescent nature of the near-field pressure produced by a propeller, measurements were made in a non-anechoic environment and were relatively unaffected by background noise or reverberation effects. The near-field acoustic data was used as input to an inverse problem to estimate the aerodynamic loading distribution on the propeller blades. The method was applied first to the numerical data for validation and then to the experimental data as a demonstration. The reconstructed loading distributions were then used as input to a method for calculating the radiated acoustic field and the predictions show good agreement with a direct projection using the measured near-field experimental data.},

Simulations demonstrate that both the acoustic field look-up table (ALUT) method and the acoustic field sub-regional look-up table (ASLUT) method have the same acoustic field calculation results as the point source method. Regarding the cost of time, the acoustic field look-up table method takes only one third of the time of the point source method, and the acoustic field sub-region look-up table method takes only one eighteenth of the time of the point source method, with the possibility of further reduction. Both the ALUT and ASLUT methods significantly reduce the calculation time for different types of transducers, which is beneficial for the study of planar sound source devices.},

  abstract = {Orbital angular momentum (OAM) conservation plays an important role in shaping and controlling structured light with nonlinear optics. The OAM of a beam originating from three-wave mixing should be the sum or difference of the other two inputs because no light–matter OAM exchange occurs in parametric nonlinear interactions. Here, we report anomalous OAM transfer in parametric upconversion, in which a Hermite-Gauss mode signal interacts with a specially engineered pump capable of astigmatic transformation, resulting in Laguerre-Gaussian mode sum-frequency generation (SFG). The anomaly here refers to the fact that the pump and signal both carry no net OAM, while their SFG does. We reveal experimentally that there is also an OAM inflow to the residual pump, having the same amount of that to the SFG but with the opposite sign, and thus holds system OAM conservation. This unexpected OAM selection rule improves our understanding of OAM transfer among interacting waves and may inspire new ideas for controlling OAM states via nonlinear optics.},

  abstract = {Topological acoustics has recently revolutionized fundamental concepts of acoustic propagation, giving rise to strikingly unique acoustic edge modes immune to backscattering. Despite the rapid progress in this field, simultaneous realization of reconfigurability, intelligentization, and automatic control over acoustic propagation paths is posing a great challenge. This challenge is overcome by proposing the concept of a programmable acoustic topological insulator based on two digital elements “0” or “1,” which consist of honeycomb-lattice sonic crystals made of cylindrical rods with different diameters. The acoustic propagation paths in the topological insulators can be controlled automatically by programming different coding sequences, which arises from efficient transformation of pseudospin-dependent edge modes on both interfaces of the digital elements. More importantly, a unique unit is experimentally fabricated that has either a “0” or “1” response automatically manipulated by an air cylinder, and design topological insulators with programmable functionality, to realize three digital acoustic devices, such as a single-pole double-throw switch, a single-pole single-throw switch, and a tunable logic gate. The proposed programmable topological insulators may enable future intelligent acoustic devices with exciting reconfigurable and programmable functionalities, which may lead to important advances in various applications, such as integrated acoustics, acoustic security, and information processing.},

We established a nonlinear non-Hermitian topological platform for active tuning of PT symmetry and topological states. We found that the loss in a topological defect potential in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice can be tuned solely by nonlinearity, enabling the transition between PT-symmetric and non–PT-symmetric regimes and the maneuvering of topological zero modes. The interaction between two apparently antagonistic effects is revealed: the sensitivity close to exceptional points and the robustness of non-Hermitian topological states. Our scheme using single-channel control of global PT symmetry and topology via local nonlinearity may provide opportunities for unconventional light manipulation and device applications.},

In regard to one listener in such a situation, a linear time-invariant system with two outputs and probably several inputs may be appropriate. Consider a point at the eardrum of a listener as an output of this system. The system involves, therefore, the transfer properties of sound source(s), the room under consideration and the external ear of the listener involved. Based on this perspective, prediction of both objective and subjective properties of sound fields in auditoria can be performed by using tenth-scale modelling. For this purpose, the conventional modelling method has to be extended to contain a head-related sound receiver as well as some suitable sound sources. A computer-aided procedure facilitates digital signal processing for binaural auralisation and evaluation of acoustic qualities of auditoria.},

Since then a number of recent works call for efficient estimation methods within the Bayesian framework. An efficient analysis is of practical significance for better understanding and modeling the sound energy decay process in acoustically coupled spaces or even in single spaces for reverberation time estimation. This paper will first formulate the Bayesian posterior probability distribution function (PPDF) in a matrix form to reduce the dimensionality as applied to the decay time evaluation. Based on existence of only global extremes of PPDFs as observed from extensive experimental data, this paper describes a dedicated search algorithm for an efficient estimation of decay times.},

Using the diffusion model and the experimental results the current work conducts in-depth investigations on sound pressure level distributions, providing further evidence supporting the valid application of the diffusion-equation model. Analysis of the results within the Bayesian framework allows for quantification of the double-slope characteristics of sound-energy decays obtained from the diffusion-equation numerical modeling and the experimental measurements. In particular, Bayesian decay analysis confirms sound-energy flux modeling predictions that time-dependent sound-energy flows in coupled-room systems experience feedback in the form of energy flow-direction change across the aperture connecting the two rooms in cases where the dependent room is more reverberant than the source room.},

  abstract = {Due to recent developments in concert hall design, there is an increasing interest in the analysis of sound energy decays consisting of multiple exponential decay rates. It has been considered challenging to estimate parameters associated with double-rate (slope) decay characteristics, and even more challenging when the coupled-volume systems contain more than two decay processes. To meet the need of characterizing energy decays of multiple decay processes, this work investigates coupled-volume systems using acoustic scale-models of three coupled rooms. Two Bayesian formulations are compared using the experimentally measured sound energy decay data. A fully parameterized Bayesian formulation has been found to be capable of characterization of multiple-slope decays beyond the single-slope and double-slope energy decays. Within the Bayesian framework using this fully parameterized formulation, an in-depth analysis of likelihood distributions over multiple-dimensional decay parameter space motivates the use of Bayesian information criterion, an efficient approach to solving Bayesian model selection problems that are suitable for estimating the number of exponential decays. The analysis methods are then applied to a geometric-acoustics simulation of a conceptual concert hall. Sound energy decays more complicated than single-slope and double-slope nature, such as triple-slope decays have been identified and characterized.},

The coupling apertures between two or more coupled-volume systems are of central importance for sound propagation and sound energy decays throughout the coupled-volume systems. In addition, positions of sound sources and receivers relative to the aperture also have a profound influence on the sound energy distributions and decays. This work investigates the effect of aperture size on the behavior of coupled-volume systems using both acoustic scale-models and diffusion equation models. In these physical and numerical models, the sound source and receiver positions relative to the aperture are also investigated. Through systematic comparisons between results achieved from both physical scale models and numerical models, this work reveals valid ranges and limitations of the diffusion equation model for room-acoustic modeling.},

The presence of the topological charges protects the degeneracy points against perturbations and enables a variety of fascinating phenomena.

Here, we introduce the concept of charged nodal surface, a two-dimensional band degeneracy surface in momentum space that is topologically charged. We provide an effective Hamiltonian for this charged nodal surface and show that such a Hamiltonian can be implemented in a tight-binding model. This is followed by an experimental realization in a phononic crystal. The measured topologically protected surface arc state of such an acoustic semimetal reproduces excellently the full-wave simulations. Creating high-dimensional charged geometric objects in momentum space promises a broad range of unexplored topological physics.},

To obtain higher security of the metasurface holography, orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) of EM waves is taken into consideration as new freedom of the metasurface holography. The use two coding information metasurfaces is proposed to achieve the OAM-encrypted holography. One metasurface is used to generate different OAM beams with l = ±1 helical mode indices, which functions as the OAM feed; while the other is used to integrate different OAM helical-phase wavefronts into the holograms of the transmitted images, forming the OAM-encrypted holography. The predesigned images are accurately decoded only when the OAM-encrypted metasurface is illuminated by the incident OAM beams with the inverse helical mode indices (l = ∓1) under the incidence of defined polarization states. Experimental results agree well with the theoretical design and numerical simulations, verifying the feasibility and security of the OAM-encrypted holography. The proposed method will be a good candidate to enhance the secure communication systems and imaging systems.},

However, the convolution operation used in PANNs is limited in capturing the long-time dependencies within an audio signal, thereby leading to potential performance degradation in audio captioning. This letter presents a novel method using graph attention (GraphAC) for encoder-decoder based audio captioning. In the encoder, a graph attention module is introduced after the PANNs to learn contextual association (i.e. the dependency among the audio features over different time frames) through an adjacency graph, and a top-k mask is used to mitigate the interference from noisy nodes. The learnt contextual association leads to a more effective feature representation with feature node aggregation. As a result, the decoder can predict important semantic information about the acoustic scene and events based on the contextual associations learned from the audio signal. Experimental results show that GraphAC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with PANNs as the encoders, thanks to the incorporation of the graph attention module into the encoder for capturing the long-time dependencies within the audio signal.

When desired sound is present, the state-of-the-art methods add a separate system to reconstruct it. This can result in distortion and latency. In this work, we propose a multi-channel ANC system that only reduces sound from undesired directions, and the system truly preserves the desired sound instead of reproducing it. The proposed algorithm imposes a spatial constraint on the hybrid ANC cost function to achieve spatial selectivity. Based on a six-channel microphone array on a pair of augmented eyeglasses, results show that the system minimized only noise coming from undesired directions. The control performance could be maintained even when the array was heavily perturbed. The proposed algorithm was also compared with the existing methods in the literature. Not only did the proposed system provide better noise reduction, but it also required much less effort. The binaural localization cues did not need to be reconstructed since the system preserved the physical sound wave from the desired source.},

  abstract = {The capacity of free-space optical (FSO) communication links could potentially be increased by the simultaneous transmission of multiple orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams. For such an OAM multiplexing approach, one requires the collection of adequate power as well as proportion of the phase front for a system with minimal crosstalk. Here we study the design considerations for an OAM-multiplexed free-space data link, analyzing the power loss, channel crosstalk, and power penalty of the link in the case of limited-size receiver apertures and misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver. We describe the trade-offs for different transmitted beam sizes, receiver aperture sizes, and mode spacing of the transmitted OAM beams under given lateral displacements or receiver angular errors. Through simulations and some experiments, we show that (1)\&\#xA0;a system with a larger transmitted beam size and a larger receiver aperture is more tolerant to lateral displacement but less tolerant to the receiver angular error, and (2)\&\#xA0;a system with a larger mode spacing, which uses larger OAM charges, suffers more system power loss but less channel crosstalk; thus, a system with a small mode spacing shows a lower system power penalty when system power loss dominates (e.g., a small lateral displacement or receiver angular error), whereas that with a larger mode spacing shows a lower power penalty when channel crosstalk dominates (e.g., a larger lateral displacement or receiver angular error). This work could be beneficial to the practical implementation of OAM-multiplexed FSO links.},

  abstract = {A stochastic-parallel-gradient-descent algorithm (SPGD) based on Zernike polynomials is proposed to generate the phase correction pattern for a distorted orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam. The Zernike-polynomial coefficients for the correction pattern are obtained by monitoring the intensity profile of the distorted OAM beam through an iteration-based feedback loop. We implement this scheme and experimentally show that the proposed approach improves the quality of the turbulence-distorted OAM beam. Moreover, we apply phase correction patterns derived from a probe OAM beam through emulated turbulence to correct other OAM beams transmitted through the same turbulence. Our experimental results show that the patterns derived this way simultaneously correct multiple OAM beams propagating through the same turbulence, and the crosstalk among these modes is reduced by more than 5\&\#xA0;dB.},

  abstract = {A weak variational principle based approach is presented in this paper to study the sound field inside the acoustic enclosures with walls in arbitrary inclination and impedance conditions. The whole acoustic domain is firstly divided into several sub-cavities with trapezoidal and rectangular faces, and each sub-cavity is coupled with adjacent ones by matching the required continuity constraints on the interfaces on the basis of a modified variational principle and least-squares weighted residual method. By using this domain partitioning strategy, high-order acoustic modes and responses can be easily achieved. Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials of the first kind are employed as the wholly admissible unknown sound pressure functions for each sub-cavity without meshing process like FEM/BEM does, and then each physical domain is mapped into a square spectral domain. To demonstrate the convergence, accuracy and stability of the approach, the modal and sound response analyses of several configurations of cavities are examined and compared with available analytical solutions, or those obtained by using FEM. Effects of the weighted parameters together with the number of truncated polynomial terms and the divided cavity segments on the accuracy of present solutions are investigated. Key parametric studies concerning the influences of the geometrical properties as well as the impedance boundary of enclosing walls are also performed. It is demonstrated that the present method is a computationally efficient way to achieve interior sound predictions in mid-frequency range with a satisfactory accuracy of solutions.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying multiple sound sources occurs in various fields. This study proposes a method for multi-source localization and sound power estimation based on three-dimensional sound intensity (3DSI) measurement combined with high-precision beamforming. First, according to the propagation law of the point source in the free field and 3DSI measurement method, a mathematical model of the sound intensity vector, sound power, and source location in 3D space for multiple sources is derived. The 3DSI components can be measured by 3DSI probes. To reduce the computational cost required to solve the mathematical model, the angles of the sources are estimated via compressive sensing beamforming orthogonal matching pursuit for the method. Moreover, the sound intensity components and angles are used as inputs in the multiple sound source identification model, and the dimensions of the model are significantly reduced. The model was solved to obtain sound source distance and sound power. Two tetrahedral intensity probes and a 16-channel microphone array were used for experiments in a semi-anechoic chamber. The results demonstrate that the method can accurately identify the locations of multiple sound sources and determine the sound power. Considering three sound sources, the maximum angular error is 1.41°, while the maximum distance error is 0.08~m. This method can use a small number of probes to obtain the sound sources spatial position and sound source power, and it improve the resolution and calculation efficiency.},

Studies on a point source in rectangular enclosures show that the hybrid modal expansion converges notably faster than the traditional modal expansions, especially in the region near the source, and introduces much smaller errors with a limited number of modes. The hybrid modal expansion can be easily applied to complex sound sources if the free field responses of the sources are known. Damped boundaries are also considered in this paper, and a set of modified modal functions is introduced, which is shown to be suitable for many damped boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {In a diffuse sound field, prior research has established that a secondary source can theoretically achieve perfect cancellation at an error microphone in the far field of the secondary source. However, the sound pressure level is generally only reduced in a small zone around the error sensor, and at a distance half of a wavelength away from the error sensor, the averaged sound pressure level will be increased by more than 10\,dB. Recently an acoustic energy quantity, referred to as the generalized acoustic energy density (GED), has been introduced. The GED is obtained by using a weighting factor in the formulation of total acoustic energy density. Different values of the weighting factor can be chosen for different applications. When minimizing the GED at the error sensor, one can adjust the weighting factor to increase the spatial extent of the “quiet zone” and to achieve a desired balance between the degree of attenuation in the quiet zone and the total energy added into the sound field.},

By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-reflecting platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability.

In this Letter, we present physical realization of an acoustic waveguide with spatiotemporally modulated boundary conditions to realize nonreciprocal transport and acoustic topological pumping. The modulated waveguide inspired by a water wheel consists of a helical tube rotating around a slotted tube at a controllable speed. The rotation of the helical tube creates moving boundary conditions for the exposed waveguide sections at a constant speed. We experimentally demonstrate acoustic nonreciprocity and topologically robust bulk-edge correspondences for this system, which is in good agreement with analytical and numerical predictions. The nonreciprocal waveguide is a one-dimensional analog to the two-dimensional quantum Hall effect for acoustic circulators and is characterized by a robust integer-valued Chern number. These findings provide insight into practical implications of topological modes in acoustics and the implementation of higher-dimensional topological acoustics where time serves as a synthetic dimension.},

The EMI induces voltages on the order of a few millivolts on conductors, which are then converted into baseband signals by exploiting the inherent nonlinearity of microphones. The EMI signal is specially preprocessed to minimize the useless harmonics generation at the microphone output signals, which significantly improves the recognition rate as well as nullify the previous countermeasures based on the harmonics detection. The sensitive carrier frequency found by our proposed method can improve the attack distance as well. A measurement-based methodology is applied to locate the sensitive regions for noise coupling without knowing the layout of the printed circuit board (PCB), and the transfer function is also obtained to insure the main coupling location. Our experiments show that in open space, intentional EMI under 2.5 W can inject commands at distances up to 2.5 m on smart speakers.},

The Fourier law should be modified after homogenizing spatiotemporal parameters, featuring thermal Willis coupling between heat flux and temperature change rate. Thermal Willis coupling drives asymmetric heat diffusion, and the diffusion direction is reversible at a critical point determined by the degree of spatiotemporal modulation. Moreover, thermal Willis coupling stands robustly even when only thermal conductivity is modulated.

The current work proposes a method based on genetic algorithm to optimize the random arrangement of array elements, so that the suppression effect of grating lobes can be significantly improved with reduced calculating time. The maximum and average kerfs of array elements are used as genes, and the ratio of the maximum to the secondary maximum sound pressure at the focal plane is used as the optimized target. Typically, the calculation requirements of the current method can be reduced to ∼25\% of the traversing method. We further discuss how the kerf width, the effective ratio of element areas and the ratio of focal distance to array aperture affect the suppression of grating lobes. For a typical linear array with 32 elements (1-MHz operating frequency, 1.5-mm element width and 150-mm focal distance), the results suggest that the grating lobes are suppressed well when (1) the ratio of maximum width to average width of the element is between 5 and 8, (2) the ratio of the effective element area to the area of the whole array is between 0.5 and 0.9, and (3) the ratio of the effective emission aperture to the actual emission aperture of the array is as large as possible. Based on optimized parameters, an experimental array was fabricated and the measured results of corresponding sound field were entirely consistent with the simulated results.},

  abstract = {In tissue harmonic imaging (THI) the images are formed using the second harmonic  component that is generated nonlinearly when ultrasound propagates inside  the body. THI improves image resolution by reducing effects of phase distortion  and reverberation in the body wall layer. A statistical investigation was  performed to quantify improvement achieved with THI in the presence of tissue  inhomogeneity. The investigation was both theoretical and experimental. In the  theoretical model, a thin random phase screen located just in front of the source  approximates the effect of inhomogeneity in the body wall layer. The phase  variations across the screen are characterized statistically by zero mean, small  variance, and Gaussian spatial correlation function. An analytical solution was  derived for the expected value of the intensity of the second harmonic for a source  that radiates a focused Gaussian beam. Contributions due to the coherent and  scattered field components appear as separate terms in the solution. Validity  of the statistical solution was established by comparison with ensemble averages  of direct numerical simulations. Evolution of the beam profile and variation in  energy content of the scattered second harmonic as a function of phase screen  statistics are discussed. In comparison with the scattered field at the source  frequency, the scattered field at the second-harmonic frequency is shown to be  more localized about the beam axis. The results demonstrate clearly and quantitatively  how distortions due to phase aberrations near the source are reduced  by THI. Numerical simulations were also performed for beams radiated from a  focused circular source with uniform amplitude. These results exhibit similar  behavior. Dependence of results from the theoretical model on the distance between  the source and phase screen was investigated. A transformation based on  geometrical acoustics was obtained that approximates the mean scattered field  due to a phase screen at a given distance away from the source using the solution  obtained when the phase screen is in the source plane. Use of multiple  phase screens to approximate thick inhomogeneous layers was also investigated.  Experiments performed with a focused circular source and phase screens created  with randomly indented plastic plates confirm the general theoretical approach.},

However, their performances are strongly depended on the proper setting of the initial sampling locations, which are typically obtained by gridding the continuous array aperture. Such a setting is usually hard to handle for large planar array synthesis. To address this problem, a precision and effective method based on the perturbed compressive sampling (PCS) is proposed. Position perturbation variables are augmented to the traditional CS-based model, which allow continuous element placement. Then, a joint sparse recovery approach is used to optimise the excitations and position perturbations of the elements simultaneously. Moreover, the authors implement an extended PCS model with a secondary grid strategy to reduce the modelling error and the computational cost. The proposed design problem is solved with a general sparse recovery solver, named FOCal under-determined system solver. Numerical results show that the method yields a higher array sparsity, a faster computational speed and a better pattern matching accuracy than the existing CS-based methods.},

Furthermore, the beamforming approach is extended to the design of a broadband beamformer. In this paper, a single sideband modulation (SSB) system is developed for transmitting audio signal due to its efficient use of both power and bandwidth.

A directional audible sound can be generated by amplitude-modulating the ultrasound carrier with an audio signal, then transmitting it from a parametric loudspeaker. This brings the need of a computationally efficient model to describe the propagation of finite-amplitude sound beams for the system design and optimization. A quasilinear analytical solution capable of fast numerical evaluation is presented for the second-order fields of the sum-, differencefrequency and second harmonic components. It is based on a virtual-complex-source approach, wherein the source field is treated as an aggregation of a set of complex virtual sources located in complex distance, then the corresponding fundamental sound field is reduced to the computation of sums of simple functions by exploiting the integrability of Gaussian functions. By this result, the five-dimensional integral expressions for the second-order sound fields are simplified to one-dimensional integrals. Furthermore, a substantial analytical reduction to sums of single integrals also is derived for an arbitrary source distribution when the basis functions are expressible as a sum of products of trigonometric functions. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by a comparison of numerical results with experimental data previously published for the rectangular ultrasonic transducer.},

Then, the system framework and some key techniques of content-based 3D model retrieval are identified and explained, including canonical coordinate normalization and preprocessing, feature extraction, similarity match, query representation and user interface, and performance evaluation. In particular, similarity measures using semantic clues and machine learning methods, as well as retrieval approaches using nonshape features, are given adequate recognition as improvements and complements for traditional shape-matching techniques. Typical 3D model retrieval systems and search engines are also listed and compared. Finally, future research directions are indicated, and an extensive bibliography is provided.},

  abstract = {Based on the acoustic radiation of point source, a phase-coded approach is proposed as a general technology to generate controllable acoustical vortices. For N sources, acoustical vortices can be generated with the phase difference of 2πm/N for the source topological charge m. It is proved that more circular pressure distributions of acoustical vortices with higher pressure peak amplitude can be generated for more sources. The number and spiral direction of phase twists are demonstrated to be determined by m and the maximum topological charge of acoustical vortices is |L|=Fix[(N−1)/2], where Fix(x) rounds the element x toward zero. To produce acoustical vortices with a maximum topological charge L, the minimum source number of Nmin=max(2|L|+1,4) should be employed with the phase difference of 2πL/Nmin and the phase difference resolution is also demonstrated to be π. The phase-coded approach has been verified by a 6-source experiment. The measured distributions of pressure and phase as well as the topological charge of acoustical vortices agree well with theoretical results, which suggest the feasibility of the phase-coded approach for controllable generation of acoustical vortices.},

  abstract = {Harvesting longitudinal ultrasonic energy from the surroundings has been highlighted as an alternative to conventional batteries. The energy can be used to power portable electronics and wireless sensors operating at remote locations. In this paper, an ultrasonic energy harvester made of a 1–3 piezoelectric composite is proposed. This harvester could convert longitudinal-mode ultrasonic vibrations into electrical energy. A theoretical analysis of a 1–3 piezoelectric composite harvester operating with thickness-stretch modes is performed. The results show that maximum output power dissipated in the load can be achieved when the load resistor is equal to the impedance of the harvester. Under such conditions, two peaks of maximum output power occur at the antiresonance frequency and resonance frequency. An experimental study following the theoretical model confirms the feasibility of extracting certain amounts of ultrasonic vibration energy using a 1–3 piezoelectric composite harvester. Both the experimental and theoretical studies show that the output voltages for different pure resistive loads peak at different operating frequencies. As the pure resistive load increases, the operating frequency varies from the resonance frequency to the antiresonance frequency.},

Using such technologies sensors enclosed in hermetical metal containers can be powered and communicate through exterior power sources without penetration of the metal wall for wire feed-throughs. In this review, we first discuss the significant and essential requirements for through-metal-wall power delivery and data transmission and then we: (1) describe three electromagnetic coupling based techniques reported in the literature, which include inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, and magnetic resonance coupling; (2) present a detailed review of wireless ultrasonic through-metal-wall power delivery and/or data transmission methods; (3) compare various ultrasonic through-metal-wall systems in modeling, transducer configuration and communication mode with sensors; (4) summarize the characteristics of electromagnetic-based and ultrasound-based systems, evaluate the challenges and development trends. We conclude that electromagnetic coupling methods are suitable for through thin non-ferromagnetic metal wall power delivery and data transmission at a relatively low data rate; piezoelectric transducer-based ultrasonic systems are particularly advantageous in achieving high power transfer efficiency and high data rates; the combination of more than one single technique may provide a more practical and reliable solution for long term operation.},

Acoustic technologies frequently develop in tandem with optics, using shared concepts such as waveguiding and metamedia. It is thus noteworthy that an entirely novel class of electromagnetic waves, known as “topological edge states,” has recently been demonstrated. These are inspired by the electronic edge states occurring in topological insulators, and possess a striking and technologically promising property: the ability to travel in a single direction along a surface without backscattering, regardless of the existence of defects or disorder. Here, we develop an analogous theory of topological fluid acoustics, and propose a scheme for realizing topological edge states in an acoustic structure containing circulating fluids. The phenomenon of disorder-free one-way sound propagation, which does not occur in ordinary acoustic devices, may have novel applications for acoustic isolators, modulators, and transducers.},

Many valleytronic materials follow the model of a gapped graphene. Yet the previously demonstrated valley acoustic crystal adopted a mirror-symmetry-breaking mechanism, lacking a direct counterpart in condensed matter systems. In this paper, we investigate a two-dimensional (2D) periodic acoustic resonator system with inversion symmetry breaking, as an analogue of a gapped graphene monolayer. It demonstrates the quantum valley Hall topological phase for sound waves. Similar to a gapped graphene, gapless topological valley edge states can be found at a zigzag domain wall separating different domains with opposite valley Chern numbers, while an armchair domain wall hosts no gapless edge states. Our study offers a route to simulate novel valley phenomena predicted in gapped graphene and other 2D materials with classical acoustic waves.},

In this work, by introducing the intrinsic pseudospin degree of freedom, we theoretically and experimentally present the existence of the helical higher-order topological states in the C6-symmetric topological crystalline insulators based on the acoustic samples. Crucially, rather than considering the global interaction of the large bulk, we further intuitively reveal the impacts of the geometries of the crystal on the generation mechanisms and natural behaviors of these states based on the simple equivalent models. These results provide a versatile way for guiding the design of the desired topological materials.},

Recent theories have proposed an alternative mechanism for negative refraction: Synthetic gauge fields, induced by either dynamical modulation or motion, can shift a material’s dispersion in momentum space, forcing a positive refractive index medium to exhibit negative refraction above a certain threshold. However, this phenomenon has not previously been observed. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of gauge field–induced negative refraction in a twisted bilayer acoustic metamaterial. The synthetic gauge fields arise in a projected two-dimensional geometry and can be continuously tuned by varying the wave number along the third dimension. Gauge field–induced waveguiding with backward-propagating modes is also demonstrated in a trilayer configuration. These results introduce a mechanism for performing wave manipulation in artificially engineered materials.},

  abstract = {A theoretical model is presented for the prediction of sound radiated from a semi-infinite unbaffled long enclosure with the ground. This geometrical arrangement forms an idealized representation of traffic tunnels and railway stations where noise propagates inside the long enclosures and radiates to the outside through the openings. Despite the fact that the model described here applies only to idealized situations, it contains essential elements of realistic configurations which are conducive to understanding the physics of the sound radiation phenomenon and significant for the proposal of appropriate noise control strategies. First of all, by expressing the sound field in terms of the superposition of propagating modes inside the long enclosure and adopting the Fourier transform in other regions, the intractable boundary value problem in the natural domain is reduced to a scalar modified Wiener-Hopf (W-H) equation of the second kind in the spectral domain. Then, its solution is obtained using the standard factorization and decomposition procedures, and the radiated sound field is attained through the inverse Fourier transform which involves a contour integral that can be evaluated approximately via the saddle point method. After that, the finite element method (FEM) is adopted to validate the model. Far-field directivity patterns of the radiated sound fields are presented. Finally, the properties of the sound fields both inside and outside three enclosures with different boundary conditions are analyzed, based on which, potential noise reduction methods by using acoustic liners are discussed.},

  abstract = {In active noise control system, the omnidirectional loudspeakers are utilized as the control source to suppress the noise in the targeted area. However, the sound pressure levels of noise remote from the targeted area in the sound field may actually increase. Based on the parametric theory, the parametric loudspeaker generates highly directional audible sound due to the nonlinear interaction of ultrasound waves with neighboring frequencies. As a result of the high directivity, the parametric loudspeakers can be used as the control source to reduce the sound pressure levels at the control points without noise augment in other areas. In this study, the application of the parametric loudspeaker as a secondary source in active noise control system is discussed. The power outputs of both the primary and secondary sources are analyzed by the impedance-based approach. It is found that when the total power output of the two sources is minimized, the secondary source absorbs the acoustic power of the primary source because of the weak coupling between the two sources. Under such circumstances the minimization of the power output of the primary source is the same as the maximization of the power absorption of the secondary source. Furthermore, the quiet zone generated by the control system in a pure tone sound field is examined as well. Results from computer simulation and experimental measurements show that there is a quiet zone along the axial direction of the secondary source, when the two sources are arranged in a line. There is negligible increase of sound pressure in the sound field and the total acoustic power is reduced after control. In addition, the disadvantages of the exploitation of the parametric loudspeaker as the control source are discussed as well.},

  abstract = {Four orthogonal polynomials for reconstructing a wavefront over a square aperture based on the modal method are currently available, namely, the 2D Chebyshev polynomials, 2D Legendre polynomials, Zernike square polynomials and Numerical polynomials. They are all orthogonal over the full unit square domain. 2D Chebyshev polynomials are defined by the product of Chebyshev polynomials in x and y variables, as are 2D Legendre polynomials. Zernike square polynomials are derived by the Gram\&\#x2013;Schmidt orthogonalization process, where the integration region across the full unit square is circumscribed outside the unit circle. Numerical polynomials are obtained by numerical calculation. The presented study is to compare these four orthogonal polynomials by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments from the aspects of reconstruction accuracy, remaining errors, and robustness. Results show that the Numerical orthogonal polynomial is superior to the other three polynomials because of its high accuracy and robustness even in the case of a wavefront with incomplete data.},

Among various types of metasurfaces, geometric metasurface that encodes a geometric or Pancharatnam–Berry phase into the orientation angle of the constituent meta-atoms has shown great potential in controlling light in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. The robust and dispersionless nature of the geometric phase simplifies the wave manipulation tremendously. Benefitting from the continuous phase control, metasurface holography has exhibited advantages over conventional depth controlled holography with discretized phase levels. Here we report on spin and wavelength multiplexed nonlinear metasurface holography, which allows construction of multiple target holographic images carried independently by the fundamental and harmonic generation waves of different spins. The nonlinear holograms provide independent, nondispersive and crosstalk-free post-selective channels for holographic multiplexing and multidimensional optical data storages, anti-counterfeiting, and optical encryption.},

The interplay of such real space topology with the emergent band topology defined in reciprocal space gives rise to gapless helical modes bound to the line defects. This is known as bulk-dislocation correspondence, in contrast to the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence featuring topological states at boundaries. However, to date rare compelling experimental evidences have been presented for this intriguing topological observable in solid-state systems, owing to the huge challenges in creating controllable dislocations and conclusively identifying topological signals. Here, using a three-dimensional acoustic weak topological insulator with precisely controllable dislocations, we report an unambiguous experimental evidence for the long-desired bulk-dislocation correspondence, through directly measuring the gapless dispersion of the one-dimensional topological dislocation modes. Remarkably, as revealed in our further experiments, the pseudospin-locked dislocation modes can be unidirectionally guided in an arbitrarily-shaped dislocation path. The peculiar topological dislocation transport, expected in a variety of classical wave systems, can provide unprecedented control over wave propagations.},

The main research of this paper is the transmission of near field ultrasound in thin workpiece and the law of the interaction of tiny flaws. The paper establishes the relationship between the longitudinal wave signal and the structure of the workpiece and the types of flaws. A method is found that whether there are flaws can be determined near field area by analysing the acoustic field characteristics of workpiece surface. Finally, comparing the calculation results with the finite element simulation, they verify each other, the method turns out to be correct in this paper. The model can also be used to improve the ultrasonic noise reduction algorithm and the extraction of minimal defect feature. It has a greatly practical significance.},

  abstract = {The long range and high data rate communication are two main targets of point to point underwater acoustic communication (PPUAC). In order to achieve the longer communication range, low frequency is the best choice. However, the data rate is limited by narrow available bandwidth at low frequency. So, the system band select must compromise between the data rate and communication range according to the application scenarios. Parametric array can achieve considerable bandwidth at the low frequency band with narrow beam pattern by nonlinear acoustics conversion. These characteristics meet the requirements of both data rate and communication range to a certain extent, and make the channel equalization more simple and effective. A PPUAC scheme based on differential pattern time delay shift coding using parametric array has been proposed. The system employs a 150 kHz primary frequency then get a 10 kHz secondary frequency wave. A proof test has been carried out under ice in SongHua River, HeiLongjiang Province, China. The error free communication was achieved in the trial. The communication scheme is expected to been used in underwater platform directional remote control and other scenarios.},

An interesting concept is the one of a temporal interface, the time-analogue of a spatial interface, formed by an abrupt and uniform change of the EM properties of the host medium in time. A time interface scatters the incident wave in a dual fashion compared to its spatial counterpart, conserving momentum but transforming frequency and exchanging energy with the wave. This article provides an overview of the wave-scattering features induced by time interfaces from an antennas and propagation engineering perspective. We first discuss the dualities of wave propagation across spatial and temporal interfaces, by recasting the telegrapher equations in a linear time-variant (LTV) transmission line (TL). Then, we introduce the scattering matrix to describe temporal scattering processes, and derive the conditions for reciprocity and momentum conservation. Understanding temporal scattering through the lens of conventional microwave engineering theory may facilitate the analysis and implementation of next-generation metamaterials encompassing temporal degrees of freedom.},

In the pursuit of better performance and broad band control, multiple resonators or a resonator array are usually needed. The interaction among resonators significantly impacts on the control performance and leads to the requirement for a systematic design tool to determine their locations. In this work, simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is employed to optimize the locations of a set of long T-shaped acoustic resonators (TARs) for noise control inside an enclosure. Multiple optimal configurations are shown to exist. The control performance in terms of sound pressure level reduction, however, seems to be independent of the initial resonator-locations. Optimal solutions obtained from the SA approach are shown to outperform other existing methods for a TAR array design. Numerical simulations are systematically verified by experiments. Optimal locations are then synthesized, leading to a set of criteria, applicable to the present configuration, to guide engineering applications. It is concluded that the proposed optimization approach provides a systematic and effective tool to optimize the locations of TARs in noise control inside enclosures.},

Combining non-Hermitian skin effect with nonlinear effects can give rise to a host of novel phenomenas, which may be used for nonlinear structure designs. Here we study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect and explore nonlocal and substantial effects of edges on stationary nonlinear solutions. We show that fractal and continuum bands arise in a long lattice governed by a nonreciprocal discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We show that stationary solutions are localized at the edge in the continuum band. We consider a non-Hermitian Ablowitz-Ladik model and show that nonlinear exceptional point disappears if the lattice is infinitely long.},

We find the redshift of the resonance peak of the perfect electric conducting cylinder to be approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than for the dielectric cylinder. The errors in our approximate analytic formula for predicting the redshift are approximately only twice as great. Furthermore, we apply the redshift formula to a silicon cylinder and discuss its magneto-dielectric properties, which may be of interest in design of metamaterials.}

  abstract = {A novel numerical model was developed to simulate three-dimensional nonlinear fields generated by high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) arrays. The model is based on the solution to the Westervelt equation; the developed algorithm makes it possible to model nonlinear pressure fields of periodic waves in the presence of shock fronts localized near the focus. The role of nonlinear effects in a focused beam of a two-dimensional array was investigated in a numerical experiment in water. The array consisting of 256 elements and intensity range on the array elements of up to 10 W/cm2 was considered. The results of simulations have shown that for characteristic intensity outputs of modern HIFU arrays, nonlinear effects play an important role and shock fronts develop in the pressure waveforms at the focus.},

  abstract = {Despite their widespread use for performing advanced computational tasks, digital signal processors suffer from several restrictions, including low speed, high power consumption and complexity, caused by costly analogue-to-digital converters. For this reason, there has recently been a surge of interest in performing wave-based analogue computations that avoid analogue-to-digital conversion and allow massively parallel operation. In particular, novel schemes for wave-based analogue computing have been proposed based on artificially engineered photonic structures, that is, metamaterials. Such kinds of computing systems, referred to as computational metamaterials, can be as fast as the speed of light and as small as its wavelength, yet, impart complex mathematical operations on an incoming wave packet or even provide solutions to integro-differential equations. These much-sought features promise to enable a new generation of ultra-fast, compact and efficient processing and computing hardware based on light-wave propagation. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the field of computational metamaterials, surveying the state-of-the-art metastructures proposed to perform analogue computation. We further describe some of the most exciting applications suggested for these computing systems, including image processing, edge detection, equation solving and machine learning. Finally, we provide an outlook for the possible directions and the key problems for future research.},

Accordingly, more than 200 articles in the area of acoustic performance of these structures are rolled up and reviewed. To achieve this end, in the first step, all of the existence papers are categorized and classified based on the thematic correspondent. Herewith, not only some appropriate descriptions about the importance of the issue are given but also a series of basic equations and generalities in this field are developed. The paper is then conducted to focus on the various theories in order to present the reliable results according to thickness of structures. In this regard, different theories including classical, shear deformation and three-dimensional are highlighted. To extend the review, a comprehensive explanation is provided with emphasis on the type of materials such as composite, isotropic and functionally graded. It is useful to note that sandwich plate structures with their subdivisions are also set in this group. Consequently, the structures are organized according to their boundary conditions. Besides, the importance of type of incident field is inspected, too. Subsequently, in order to remark the methods employed by the researchers, the works are reviewed based on their solution techniques. Before concluding remarks, the remained papers are classified on the basis of various procedures such as optimization and control of sound transmission through plate structures.},

  abstract = {Two side-by-side energy windows are sometimes employed in quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. The count-rate losses at high activities for a GE400AT camera were measured in such a dual-window-acquisition mode by imaging a decaying source composed of a hot sphere within a warm cylinder. The data in each window was either kept separate or combined for purposes of dead-time correction and the paralyzable model was assumed. In addition, correction factors were derived from a "monitor" source at the edge of the camera. Finally, energy spectra for only the monitor-source region of interest and for the entire camera were obtained under both low- and high-count conditions and compared. With 99mTc (1) the spectral measurements show no peak shift but reveal pulse-pile-up spectral degradation. (2) The monitor-source corrections do not agree well with those from the model, presumably because of the differential effects of such degradation. For this camera the preferred correction method for patients is one using the model and two, effective, phantom-derived dead times for the separate data from the two windows. The two effective dead times are needed to compensate for pulse pile-up adding more counts to the lower-energy window than to the higher-energy one at high rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

A numerical example simulates a 1444-element spherical-section phased array that delivers heat to a 3-cm-diameter spherical tumor located 12 cm from the array aperture, and the results show that waveform diversity combined with mode scanning increases the heated volume within the tumor while simultaneously decreasing normal tissue heating. Whereas standard single focus and multiple focus methods are often associated with unwanted intervening tissue heating, the waveform diversity method combined with mode scanning shifts energy away from intervening tissues where hotspots otherwise accumulate to improve temperature localization in deep-seated tumors.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a unique phenomenon studied intensively in non-Hermitian systems during the past few years. In this work, we discuss the energy dependence of NHSE by introducing nonreciprocity beyond the nearest-neighboring hopping in the one-dimensional lattices. The direction of NHSE reverses as the eigenenergy of the system under open boundary conditions (OBCs) sweeps across some critical energies. To characterize such a phenomenon, we introduce the concept of non-Hermitian skin effect edges, which separate the eigenstates localized at opposite ends of the lattice in the OBC spectrum. We find the skin effect edges are determined by the self-intersections in the spectrum under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), which are topological as the winding number of the PBC spectrum changes sign when crossing them. Moreover, the NHSE edges will disappear when the self-intersections merge into a single point by tuning the system parameters. Our work reveals the intricate interplay between NHSE and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.},

In this Rapid Communication, we show experimentally that linear active Willis metamaterials breaking these constraints enable highly nonreciprocal sound transport in very subwavelength structures. Furthermore, we present an experimental procedure to extract the effective material parameters expressed in terms of acoustic polarizabilities for media in which the Willis coupling terms are not constrained by the relationship holding in unbiased passive materials. The approach presented here will enable a generation of ultracompact Willis materials for enhanced sound control and improved acoustic imaging and signal processing.},

  abstract = {Metasurfaces that manipulate the reflection of impinging sound have recently received significant attention, but virtually all past designs are passive structures with high temporal and spatial dispersion and thus have narrow bandwidths and are unidirectional. In this work, we introduce a method to design omnidirectional and broadband anomalous acoustic reflectors composed of nonresonant active scatterers arranged in a periodic lattice of subwavelength periodicity. The method relies on the manipulation of the wave-vector component parallel to the reflector’s surface (i.e., transverse component) in a broadband manner and for arbitrary impinging sound directions. To illustrate our method experimentally, we design and measure an anomalous reflecting metasurface operating in free space for which the transverse wave-vector components of the incident and reflected waves differ by a prescribed constant. We show that the effect does not depend on the direction of incidence and has a bandwidth an order of magnitude larger than passive anomalous reflectors. This work shows that the active scatterers behave similarly to the atoms of a natural material rather than the unit cells of gratings or phononic crystals in that rearranging the active scatterers changes the metasurface geometry while preserving the device’s desired functionality.}

  abstract = {Cavities with asymmetrical walls exist in many industrial applications and its acoustic properties are crucial to noise and vibration control. However, traditional methods are complex and time-consuming such as finite element method (FEM). Given the problems existing in traditional methods, the ISM-TM algorithm which combined the image source model (ISM) with the transformation matrix (TM) is proposed to explore acoustic resonances of a 3D open cavity with asymmetrical walls in this work. Compared with experiments, the proposed algorithm can well obtain the acoustic resonances of a 3D open rectangle cavity and a 3D open cavity with non-parallel walls. In a 3D open rectangle cavity, with the increase of the calculation frequency, the relative error between acoustic resonant frequencies measured by experiments and estimated by the ISM-TM is reduced from 11.3\% to 0.9\%. In a 3D open cavity with non-parallel walls, with the increase of the calculation frequency, the relative error between acoustic resonant frequencies measured by experiments and estimated by the ISM-TM is reduced from 2.3\% to 0.2\%. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm in this work could well estimate acoustic resonances of a 3D open cavity for medium and high frequency. Compared with the FEM, the proposed algorithm can provide the frequency response function (FRF) of any point in a 3D open cavity easily and quickly. The ISM-TM can be used to guide cavity design to predict possible acoustic resonances in the cavity in advance.},

Comparing with the vector-based plane-wave spectrum (VPWS) method, we present an alternative approach to implement the fast Hankel transform which does not require an additional coordinate transformation for Fourier transform. The proposed FHTn method is an efficient approach for numerical evaluation of an arbitrary integer order of the Hankel transform (HT). As an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply the FHTn technique to the analysis of cylindrical EM field propagation through a diffractive microlens.},

  abstract = {Many phase transitions exhibit ordering transitions at the boundary of the material that are distinct from its interior where intermolecular interactions can be significantly different. The present work considers the existence of a surface thermodynamic order-order transition between two distinct morphologies in thin block copolymer (BCP) films that are of interest in nanomanufacturing applications. Specifically, we find a thermally reversible interfacial transition between sphere-like structures and cylinders in flow-coated films of poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA), where the BCP forms a cylinder microphase in the bulk. We present direct evidence from atomic force microscopy (AFM) of ion-etched films and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) on films without etching, which shows that the order-order transition is restricted to the outer layer of the film, while the film interior remains in the cylinder state. Moreover, we find this order-order transition to be insensitive to film thickness over the range investigated (40-170 nm). This morphological transition is of importance in characterizing the thermodynamics and dynamics of thin BCP films used as templates in nanomanufacturing applications.}

The radiation force is expressed in terms of the asymmetry of the scattered field, the scattered power, the absorbed power, and the conic angle of the Bessel beam and is related to the partial-wave coefficients for the scattering. Negative forces only occur when the scattering into the backward hemisphere is suppressed relative to the scattering into the forward hemisphere. Absorbed power degrades negative radiation forces.},

Not only do generalized nonparaxial accelerating beams open up many possibilities of beam engineering for applications, but the fundamental concept developed here can be applied to other linear wave systems in nature, ranging from electromagnetic and elastic waves to matter waves.},

Metamaterials can direct waves by spatially varying the material properties through which the wave propagates. However, this approach is not always feasible, particularly for acoustic applications. Here we demonstrate the generation of acoustic bottle beams in homogeneous space without using metamaterials. Instead, the sound energy flows through a three-dimensional curved shell in air leaving a close-to-zero pressure region in the middle, exhibiting the capability of circumventing obstacles. By designing the initial phase, we develop a general recipe for creating self-bending wave packets, which can set acoustic beams propagating along arbitrary prescribed convex trajectories. The measured acoustic pulling force experienced by a rigid ball placed inside such a beam confirms the pressure field of the bottle. The demonstrated acoustic bottle and self-bending beams have potential applications in medical ultrasound imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, as well as acoustic levitations and isolations.},

A general procedure, comprising a Wavelet–Garlerkin formulation and a so-called vertex-driven shape optimization is proposed to deal with the general problem of internal sound field prediction and the optimization of the boundary shape. It is shown that, owing to the compactly supported orthogonal property and the remarkable fitting ability, Daubechies Wavelet can be used as a global basis to approximate the unknown sound field on a relatively large interval globally instead of piecewise approximation like most of element based methods do. This feature avoids meshing the boundary of the enclosure, although vertex points are needed to define the boundary shape, whose positions keep updating during the shape optimization process. A rectangular enclosure is used as benchmark to assess and validate the proposed formulation, by investigating the influence of some key parameters involved in the formulation. It was shown that the sound pressure along the entire boundary of the rectangular enclosure can be accurately approximated without meshing. The same enclosure with an inner rigid acoustic screen is then used to reduce the sound pressure level within a chosen area through optimizing the shape of the screen, which shows the remarkable potentials of the proposed approach as a shape optimal tool for inner sound field problems.},

This paper investigates the multi-zone sound control problem formulated in the modal domain using the Lagrange cost function and provides a modal-domain analysis of the problem. The Lagrange cost function is formulated to represent a quadratic objective of reproducing a desired sound field within the bright zone and with constraints on sound energy in the dark zone and global region. A fundamental problem in multi-zone reproduction is interzone sound interference, where based on the geometry of the sound zones and the desired sound field within the bright zone the achievable reproduction performance is limited. The modal-domain Lagrangian solution demonstrates the intrinsic ill-posedness of the problem, based on which a parameter, the coefficient of realisability, is developed to evaluate the reproduction limitation. The proposed reproduction method is based on controlling the interference between sound zones and sound leakage outside the sound zones, resulting in a suitable compromise between good bright zone performance and satisfactory dark zone performance. The performance of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations of two-zone reproduction in free-field and in reverberant environments.},

When an intense vortex laser obliquely impinges onto an overdense plasma target, the reflected beam deflects out of the plane of incidence with an experimentally observable deflection angle. The mechanism is demonstrated by full three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation as well as analytical modeling using the Maxwell stress tensor. The deflection results from the rotational symmetry breaking of the foil driven by the unsymmetrical shear stress of the vortex beam. The l-dependent shear stress, where l is the topological charge, as an intrinsic characteristic to the vortex beam, plays an important role as the ponderomotive force in relativistic vortex laser matter interaction.},

  abstract = {As the primary means of communication, voice plays an important role in daily life. Voice also conveys personal information such as social status, personal traits, and the emotional state of the speaker. Mechanically, voice production involves complex fluid-structure interaction within the glottis and its control by laryngeal muscle activation. An important goal of voice research is to establish a causal theory linking voice physiology and biomechanics to how speakers use and control voice to communicate meaning and personal information. Establishing such a causal theory has important implications for clinical voice management, voice training, and many speech technology applications. This paper provides a review of voice physiology and biomechanics, the physics of vocal fold vibration and sound production, and laryngeal muscular control of the fundamental frequency of voice, vocal intensity, and voice quality. Current efforts to develop mechanical and computational models of voice production are also critically reviewed. Finally, issues and future challenges in developing a causal theory of voice production and perception are discussed.},

  abstract = {A general and complete second-order theory of nonlinear acoustics in the presence of an object is derived and shown to be consistent with experimental measurements. The total second-order field occurs at sum or difference frequencies of the primary fields and naturally breaks into (A) nonlinear waves generated by wave-wave interactions, and (B) second-order scattered waves that include the effect of centriodal motion of the object driven by a complete second-order wave-exciting force. Analytic expressions for second-order fields due to combinations of planar and spherical wave-wave interactions are derived. Wave-wave interactions are analytically shown to always dominate the total second-order field at sufficiently large range and carry only primary frequency response information about the object. As range decreases, the dominant mechanism is shown to vary with object size, boundary condition, and frequencies making it sometimes possible for sum or difference frequency response information about the object to be measured from second-order fields. Unique opportunities arise for nonlinear sum or difference frequency sensing that differ substantially from traditional sensing by linear scattering. Analytic proof shows that there is no scattering of sound by sound outside the region of compact support intersection of finite-duration plane waves at sum or difference frequencies, to second-order.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an active partition that can be placed between a snorer and a non-snorer on a bed to reduce the snoring noise around the non-snorer ears by integrating a rigid finite size passive partition with a two channel active noise control system. The noise reduction performance of the passive partition on a bed with a headboard is studied first, where the effects of the height and the width of the partition are discussed. Due to the limited partition size, the attenuation for the low-frequency diffracted noise is not sufficient, so two loudspeakers are proposed to be installed on the partition as the secondary sources to increase the overall noise attenuation. Both numerical simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed integrated snoring noise control system, and the results show that the proposed active partition can achieve over 10 dB noise attenuation at non-snorer ears in the 1/3 octave bands from 80 to 1000 Hz.},

For an ANC system with multiple secondary sources and error microphones, one approach to reducing computational complexity is to apply a decentralized control scheme rather than centralized approaches. A decentralized scheme attempts to control a number of small-size ANC subsystems independently. In this paper, we consider decentralized control of a two-channel ANC system tackling a noise disturbance in the frequency domain, where each channel consists of one secondary source and one error microphone. We propose a decentralized control method which is able to achieve the same noise reduction performance as the centralized controller with guaranteed convergence. The key step in designing the control method is to properly shape the eigenvalues of a matrix which models the two-channel secondary paths for each frequency index.},

Recently, it has been proposed and demonstrated that EPs can enhance the performance of sensors in terms of amplification of a detected signal. However, typically amplification of signals also increases the system noise, and it has not yet been shown that an EP sensor can have improved signal-to-noise performance. We develop a quantum noise theory to calculate the signal-to-noise performance of an EP sensor. We use the quantum Fisher information to extract a lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and show that parametrically improved SNR is possible. Finally, we construct a specific experimental protocol for sensing using an EP amplifier near its lasing threshold and heterodyne signal detection that achieves the optimal scaling predicted by the Fisher bound. Our results can be generalized to higher order EPs for any bosonic non-Hermitian system with linear interactions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review the generation of vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum in the microwave domain. We firstly present the theory of Laguerre–Gaussian beams where it is demonstrated that they carry such type of momentum. We further provide an overview of the classical methods used to generate orbital angular momentum vortex beams, which rely on two main methods; plane wave to vortex wave conversion and direct generation using radiating antennas. Then, we present recent progress in the physics of metasurfaces devoted to the generation of vortex beams with a discussion about reflective and transmissive metasurfaces for plane wave to vortex wave conversion as well as methods to reduce the intrinsic divergence characteristics of vortex beams. Finally, we conclude on this rapidly developing research field.},

They are widely used in practical production and belong to the category of rotary room acoustics. Therefore, the study of their acoustic characteristics is of great engineering significance. In this paper, a unified analytical model for acoustic characteristics of rotary enclosed cavity with various impedance walls is first established. A three-dimensional (3D) modified Fourier series method is proposed to construct the admissible function of sound pressure. Specifically, the sound pressure function is invariably expressed as a 3D trigonometric series superposition, which includes the multiplication of three cosine functions and six complementary polynomials. The introduction of complementary polynomials can effectively solve the impedance acoustic wall. Based on Rayleigh-Ritz energy method, the acoustic characteristics of the unified analysis model can be obtained. The sound pressure response of the cavity under the influence of different impedance walls is further studied by placing a point sound source inside the acoustic cavity. The accuracy of the unified model is verified by comparing the present results with those obtained by finite element method (FEM) and experiment, and the effect of important parameters on the acoustic characteristics is systematically studied.},

So far, all NHSE observations are based on one type of non-Hermitian band topology, in which the complex energy spectrum winds along a closed loop. As recently characterized along a synthetic dimension on a photonic platform, non-Hermitian band topology can exhibit almost arbitrary windings in momentum space, but their actual phenomena in real physical systems remain unclear. Here, we report the experimental realization of NHSE in a one-dimensional (1D) non-reciprocal acoustic crystal. With direct acoustic measurement, we demonstrate that a twisted winding, whose topology consists of two oppositely oriented loops in contact rather than a single loop, will dramatically change the NHSE, following previous predictions of unique features such as the bipolar localization and the Bloch point for a Bloch-wave-like extended state. This work reveals previously unnoticed features of NHSE, and provides the observation of physical phenomena originating from complex non-Hermitian winding topology.},

However, in higher dimensions, these effects remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate the spin-polarized, higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic higher-order topological insulators. We find that non-Hermiticity drives wave localizations toward opposite edges upon different spin polarizations. More interestingly, for finite systems with both edges and corners, the higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect leads to wave localizations toward two opposite corners for all the bulk, edge and corner states in a spin-dependent manner. We further show that such a skin effect enables rich wave manipulation by configuring the non-Hermiticity. Our study reveals the intriguing interplay between higher-order topology and non-Hermiticity, which is further enriched by the pseudospin degree of freedom, unveiling a horizon in the study of non-Hermitian physics.},

Here we demonstrate a passive remote-whispering metamaterial (RWM) enabling weak airborne sound at audible frequencies to reach unprecedented signal enhancement without altering the detected ambient soundscape, which is based on the extraordinary scattering properties of a metamaterial formed by a pair of self-resonating subwavelength Mie meta-cavities, constituting the acoustic analogy of Förster resonance energy transfer. We demonstrate efficient non-radiative sound transfer over distances hundreds times longer than the radius of the meta-cavities, which enables the RWM to recover weak sound signals completely overwhelmed by strong noise with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio from −3 dB below the detection limit of 0\,dB in free space to 17.7\,dB.},

However, most of the current acoustic wireless methods could support single wireless function and control single device. A converged wireless infrastructure that simultaneously supports the mainstream wireless functions remains inaccessible for acoustics. The difficulty lies in constructing the dynamic control network consisting of multiple nodes with acoustic method. Here, we develop the converged wireless infrastructure based on the acoustic holographic array, which serves as the central hub of the system. The holographic array allows for simultaneous control of multiple targets and integrates multiple mainstream wireless functions. We experimentally present the acoustic version of the converged wireless system that realizes a series of functions, including (i) selective wireless power transfer, (ii) stable remote monitoring, (iii) dynamic programmable logic control, and (iv) wireless acoustic communication. The wireless system is capable of powering and controlling free-moving devices. The unique immunity against electromagnetic and biological interferences is further demonstrated. The acoustic-based wireless infrastructure provides a route to wireless technologies, especially for those in electromagnetic-restricted conditions.},

The input and outcome of non-Abelian braiding are connected by a unitary matrix that can also physically emerge as a geometric-phase matrix in classical systems. Hence it is predicted that non-Abelian braiding should have analogues in photonics, although a feasible platform and the experimental realization remain out of reach. Here we propose and experimentally realize an on-chip photonic system that achieves the non-Abelian braiding of up to five photonic modes. The braiding is realized by controlling the multi-mode geometric-phase matrix in judiciously designed photonic waveguide arrays. The quintessential effect of braiding—sequence-dependent swapping of photon dwell sites—is observed in both classical-light and single-photon experiments. Our photonic chips are a versatile and expandable platform for studying non-Abelian physics, and we expect the results to motivate next-generation non-Abelian photonic devices.},

Recently, fast growing efforts are invested to the braiding topology of complex Bloch bands in non-Hermitian systems. This new classification of band topology goes far beyond those established in Hermitian counterparts. Here, we present the first acoustic realization of the topological non-Hermitian Bloch braids, based on a two-band model easily accessible for realizing any desired knot structure. The non-Hermitian bands are synthesized by a simple binary cavity-tube system, where the long-range, complex-valued, and momentum-resolved couplings are accomplished by a well-controlled unidirectional coupler. In addition to directly visualizing various two-band braiding patterns, we unambiguously observe the highly-elusive topological phase transitions between them. Not only do our results provide a direct demonstration for the non-Hermitian band topology, but also the experimental techniques open new avenues for designing unconventional acoustic metamaterials.},

Among them, growing efforts have been invested to an intriguing phenomenon, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we review the recent progress in this emerging field. By starting from the one-dimensional (1D) case, the fundamental concepts of NHSE, its minimal model, the physical meanings and consequences are elaborated in details. In particular, we discuss the NHSE enriched by lattice symmetries, which gives rise to unique non-Hermitian topological properties with revised bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) and new definitions of topological invariants. Then we extend the discussions to two and higher dimensions, where dimensional surprises enable even more versatile NH.SE phenomena. Extensions of NHSE assisted with extra degrees of freedom such as long-range coupling, pseudospins, magnetism, non-linearity and crystal defects are also reviewed. This is followed by the contemporary experimental progress for NHSE. Finally, we provide the outlooks to possible future directions and developments.},

  abstract = {Traditional multi-channel active noise control (MCANC) is based on adaptive filtering and usually uses a separate control unit for each channel. This paper introduces a deep learning based approach for multi-channel active noise control (ANC). The proposed approach, called deep MCANC, encodes optimal control parameters corresponding to different noises and environments, and jointly computes the multiple canceling signals to cancel or attenuate the primary noises captured at error microphones. A convolutional recurrent network (CRN) is employed for complex spectral mapping where the summated power of error signals is used as the loss function for CRN training. Deep MCANC is a fixed-parameter ANC approach and large-scale multi-condition training is employed to achieve robustness against a variety of noises. We explore the performance of deep MCANC with different setups and investigate the impact of factors such as the number of loudspeakers and microphones, and the position of a secondary source, on ANC performance. Experimental results show that deep MCANC is effective for wideband noise reduction and generalizes well to untrained noises. Moreover, the proposed approach is robust against variations in reference signals and works well in the presence of nonlinear distortions.},

This paper addresses low-latency ANC in the context of deep learning (i.e. deep ANC). A time-domain method using an attentive recurrent network (ARN) is employed to perform deep ANC with smaller frame sizes, thus reducing algorithmic latency of deep ANC. In addition, we introduce a delay-compensated training to perform ANC using predicted noise for several milliseconds. Moreover, a revised overlap-add method is utilized during signal resynthesis to avoid the latency introduced due to overlaps between neighboring time frames. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies for achieving low-latency deep ANC. Combining the proposed strategies is capable of yielding zero, even negative, algorithmic latency without affecting ANC performance much, thus alleviating the causality constraint in ANC design.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermiticity is revolutionizing the common understanding in the Hermitian scope by interfacing with topological physics. A single non-Hermitian band can host nontrivial topology that is defined over the nonzero windings of the system's eigenvalues, but not the eigenvectors, as opposed to the Hermitian topological systems. This unique non-Hermitian band topology is responsible for the intriguing non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we show that the band topology of non-Hermitian one-band models can experience multiple phase transitions. Each transition is identified by a change of the eigenvalue winding. Such an interesting phenomenon is enabled by strategically manipulating the long-range couplings. Associated with the multiple phase transitions, the non-Hermitian skin effect exhibits anomalous behaviors, i.e., in different phases, the skin modes take on different forms of wave localizations. At the transition points, the skin modes evolve into Bloch-wavelike extended states, as if the Hermiticity is restored. For demonstration, we consider a modified Hatano-Nelson model with nonreciprocal next-nearest neighbor couplings. Therein, two phase transitions are identified, corresponding to a stationary and a dynamic one (with respect to the reciprocal nearest-neighbor coupling). Exact analytical derivations are performed to analyze the phase transitions and the associated anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect, which show consistency with the numerical results based on the generalized Brillouin zone method. Our work reveals rich non-Hermitian topological physics in one-band systems, which are considered to be topologically trivial in Hermitian systems. By further showing the anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect, intriguing wave manipulations may inspire experiments in classical realms such as photonics and phononics where versatile non-Hermitian controls are feasible.},

Recently, fast growing efforts are invested to the braiding topology of complex Bloch bands in non-Hermitian systems. This new classification of band topology goes far beyond those established in Hermitian counterparts. Here, we present the first acoustic realization of the topological non-Hermitian Bloch braids, based on a two-band model easily accessible for realizing any desired knot structure. The non-Hermitian bands are synthesized by a simple binary cavity-tube system, where the long-range, complex-valued, and momentum-resolved couplings are accomplished by a well-controlled unidirectional coupler. In addition to directly visualizing various two-band braiding patterns, we unambiguously observe the highly elusive topological phase transitions between them. Not only do our results provide a direct demonstration for the non-Hermitian band topology, but also the experimental techniques open new avenues for designing unconventional acoustic metamaterials.},

In this paper, we propose a turbulence mitigation scheme to improve AT tolerance of the OAM-multiplexed FSO communication link using both channel coding and wavefront correction. In the scheme, we utilize a wavefront correction method to mitigate the phase distortion first, and then we use a channel code to further correct the errors in each OAM mode. The improvement of AT tolerance is discussed over the performance of the link with or without channel coding/wavefront correction. The results show that the bit error rate performance has been improved greatly. The detrimental effect of AT on the OAM-multiplexed FSO communication link could be removed by the proposed scheme even in the relatively strong turbulence regime, such as Cn2=3.6×10−14m−2/3.},

The structure vibrates strongly in response to the broadband incident noise and hence creates substantial reflection. If both the media in the cavity and the duct are air, the mass-like load from the fluid in the cavity suppresses the response of the structure and thus lowers the transmission loss. If helium, or some other gas with lower density than air in the duct, fills the cavity, the mass-like reactance of the cavity is reduced and the silencing performance is improved. Then such a silencer can achieve a satisfactory attenuation performance at low frequency range. Multiple adjacent resonant peaks are found in the transmission loss curve and such a silencer has superiority in size and acoustic performance over expansion chamber and duct lining.},

Without the enclosure, the emitted sound fields have an indistinguishable or omnidirectional radiation directivity in far fields. The strong directivity formed in the presence of the enclosure is attributed to interference of sources under degenerate Mie resonances in the enclosure of anisotropic property. Our numerical simulations of sound emission from the sources demonstrate the radiation of a highly directed sound beam of unidirectional or bidirectional patterns, depending on how the sources are configured inside the enclosure. Our scheme, if achieved, can solve the challenging problem of poor directivity of a subwavelength sound system, and can guide beam forming and collimation by miniaturized devices.},

  abstract = {Miniature piezoelectric acoustic transducers have been developed for numerous applications. Compared to other transduction mechanisms like capacitive or piezoresistive, piezoelectric transducers do not need direct current (DC) bias voltage and can work directly exposed to fluid. Hence, they are good candidates for biomedical applications that often require the transducer to work in water based fluid. Among all piezoelectric materials, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a great choice for implantable sensors because of the high electrical resistance, low dielectric loss, and biocompatibility for in vivo study. This thesis presents the design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of the AlN acoustic transducers, miniaturized to be implantable for biomedical applications like hearing or cardiovascular devices.  To design and model the transducer in air and in water, a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) model was built to study the transducer in a viscous fluid environment. An array of AlN bimorph cantilevers were designed to create a multi-resonance transducer to increase the sensitivity in a broad band frequency range. A two-wafer process using microelectricalmechanical systems (MEMS) techniques was used to fabricate the xylophone transducer with flexible cable. Benchtop testing confirmed the transducer functionality and verified the FEA model experimentally.  The transducer was then implanted inside a living cochlea of a guinea pig and tested in vivo. The piezoelectric voltage output from the transducer was measured in response to 80-95 dB sound pressure level (SPL) sinusoidal excitation spanning 1-14 kHz. The phases showed clear acoustic delay. The measured voltage responses were linear and above the noise level. These results demonstrated that the transducer can work as a sensor for a fully implantable cochlear implant.  The second generation device, an ultraminiature diaphragm transducer, was designed to be smaller, and yet with an even lower noise floor. The transducer was designed and optimized using a 2D axial-symmetric FEA model for a better figure of merit (FOM), which considered both minimal detectable pressure (MDP) and the diaphragm area. The low-frequency sensitivity was increased significantly, because of the encapsulated back cavity. Because of this merit, cardiovascular applications, which focus on low frequency signals, were also investigated. The diaphragm transducers were fabricated using MEMS techniques. Benchtop tests for both actuating and sensing confirmed the transducer functionality, and verified the design and model experimentally. The transducer had a better FOM than other existing piezoelectric diaphragm transducers, and it had a much lower MDP than the other intracochlear acoustic sensors.},

Recently, acoustic black holes have been effectively used for structural design in controlling vibration and noise. An acoustic black hole is a power-law tapered profile to reduce phase and group velocities of wave propagation to zero. Additionally, the vibration energy at the location of acoustic black hole increases due to the gradual reduction of its thickness. The vibration damping, sound reduction, and vibration energy harvesting are the major applications in structural design with acoustic black holes. In this paper, a review of basic theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies on the applications of acoustic black holes is presented. In addition, the influences of the various geometrical parameters and the configuration of acoustic black holes are presented. The studies show that the use of acoustic black holes results in an effective control of vibration and noise. It is seen that the acoustic black holes have a great potential for quiet design of complex structures.},

In this paper, a novel method is proposed for optimizing sparse array in both near-field and far-field conditions that improving the sparseness of the optimized array. First, a new energy function is proposed and successfully synthesizes sparse arrays in both near-field and far-field conditions. The simplified form of the new energy function is then presented for cutting down computational load during optimization process. Second, the nongrid sparse array technology, which connotes irregular element positioning, is introduced into the simulated annealing algorithm to extensively reduce the number of active elements. Finally, the optimized method is demonstrated through designing a cross array with 100 + 100 elements. The results show notable improvements on the array characteristics in random working distances over those reported in the literature.},

The standard angular spectrum method (ASM) is accurate but time- and memory-consuming, especially for high-NA systems. In this work, we propose a fast and simple numerical propagation method, the resampling ASM (RS-ASM). Numerical propagation can be accelerated by combining a resampling technique with interpolation methods in the angular spectrum domain of a constrained object at the focal plane. RS-ASM has three main advantages: simple implementation, faster calculation than the standard ASM, and SNR enhancement. Here we validate RS-ASM using theory, simulation and experiment. Using the “bilinear” ASM with a proper resampling factor can result in a speed-up factor of up to 20x (for a transformation from the angular spectrum to the E field) and 4x (for a transformation from E field to the angular spectrum), together with a SNR improvement of approximately 2x. For an application example of Gerchberg-Saxton phase reconstruction, the “bilinear” RS-ASM can converge 2.6x faster than the standard ASM.},

  abstract = {Personal audio systems with multiple sound zones for listeners to enjoy different music/audio contents privately in a shared physical space have attracted great research interest in the past two decades. Acoustic Contrast Control (ACC) is one of the most popular methods for generating multiple personal sound zones because it produces the minimum inter-zone interference. However, the ACC method has been found to be inferior to the pressure matching method in terms of sound quality due to an uneven frequency response and nonuniform spatial sound field distribution in the bright zone. This paper proposes a spatial uniformity constraint on time-domain broadband ACC in addition to the frequency response trend estimation constraint with the aim of ensuring a uniform sound field distribution in the bright zone. Simulation results with measured room impulse responses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the magnitude variations in the bright zone to be less than 1 dB higher than the just noticeable level difference at a cost of a perceptually negligible degradation in acoustic contrast.},

First, the systems of winding vibration and core vibration are both described by Hammerstein-type models consisting of linear and nonlinear parts. Then the links between the phase angle of the fundamental winding/core vibration and system properties are established based on those Hammerstein-type models. They indicate that the phase variation can be used as an effective indicator of deterioration in transformer stability due to mechanical defects in the winding and core. To validate this claim, laboratory experiments and field tests are conducted. In the laboratory experiment, two mechanical faults—looseness of the winding clamping structure and winding deformation—are introduced to a 110 kV power transformer. The results show that both winding clamping looseness and winding deformation will cause larger phase variation in the winding-induced vibration and core-induced vibration. In the field tests, this relationship is also observed on an abnormal 220 kV power transformer. All the findings show that the proposed indicators can provide efficient fault-related information for evaluation of a winding’s mechanical health condition.},

Here, we demonstrate fractal higher-order topological states with unprecedented emergent phenomena in a Sierpiński acoustic metamaterial. We uncover abundant topological edge and corner states in the acoustic metamaterial due to the fractal geometry. Interestingly, the numbers of the edge and corner states depend exponentially on the system size, and the leading exponent is the Hausdorff fractal dimension of the Sierpiński carpet. Furthermore, the results reveal the unconventional spectrum and rich wave patterns of the corner states with consistent simulations and experiments. This study thus unveils unconventional topological states in fractal geometry and may inspire future studies of topological phenomena in non-Euclidean geometries.},

  abstract = {Incorporating individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) into a high fidelity sound engine can further improve the perceived quality and realism of binaurally-rendered spatial audio. Traditional methods to measure individual HRTFs tend to be cumbersome, expensive and require physical access to the subject. To address these issues, we develop a convolutional neural network model that, given a single photo of an ear, predicts pinna landmarks that can be used to extract anthropometric features commonly used for HRTF personalization, and match to a database of subjects whose HRTFs and pictures are available. We propose and evaluate a system utilizing this model to generate an individualized HRTF using a minimal set of easily obtainable measurements: single photographs of both ears, as well as head and ear scale for matching interaural time difference (ITD). To extend the reach of our database we employ ideas from Kendall shape theory to match ears non-dimensionally, match all ears to right ears, and make corresponding changes to the database HRIRs. We also apply HAT models to the HRIRs to provide better matching.},

By using the image source method and the disk scattering model, the sound radiation power of an active noise control system on ground with an additional finite size semicircular rigid disk vertical to the ground is studied. It is found that the noise reduction of the system can be increased significantly with the infinitely large reflecting surface when the primary and secondary source distance is less than half of the wavelength at the frequency of interest, and the finite size disk can further increase the noise reduction performance at certain bandwidth by up to 2.3\,dB. The mechanisms for the performance increase are explored, and the experimental results are presented to validate the analytical and simulation results.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of active noise control (ANC) systems with two reflecting surfaces that are placed vertically on ground in parallel. It employs the modal expansion method and the boundary element method to calculate the noise reduction of the systems with infinitely large and finite size reflecting surfaces, respectively. Both experimental and simulation results show that the noise reduction of the system can be significantly increased after optimizing the surface separation distance and their locations with the sound sources. It is found that the sound radiation of the primary source can be completely reduced in principle if the surface interval is less than half the wavelength and the source line is perpendicular to the surfaces for infinitely large reflecting surfaces. Even with finite size ones, the noise reduction performance improvement is still significant compared with those without any reflecting surfaces. For example, for an ANC system with a source distance of 0.074\,m, experiments achieve an improvement of 8.6\,dB at 800\,Hz where two 0.2\,m\,×\,0.2 m parallel reflecting surfaces are placed with a distance of 0.15\,m around the system on ground. The mechanisms for the performance improvement are discussed.},

  abstract = {Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) plays an important role in the browning of vegetables, fruits and edible fungi. The effects of ultrasound, malic acid, and their combination on the activity and conformation of mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) PPO were studied. The activity of PPO decreased gradually with the increasing of malic acid concentrations (5-60mM). Neither medium concentrations (10, 20, 30mM) malic acid nor individual ultrasound (25kHz, 55.48W/cm(2)) treatment could remarkably inactivate PPO. However, the inactivation during their combination was more significant than the sum of ultrasound inactivation and malic acid inactivation. The inactivation kinetics of PPO followed a first-order kinetics under the combination of ultrasound and malic acid. The conformation of combination treated PPO was changed, which was reflected in the decrease of alpha-helix, increase of beta-sheet contents and disruption of the tertiary structure. Results of molecular microstructure showed that ultrasound broke large molecular groups of PPO into small ones. Moreover, combined treatment disrupted the microstructure of PPO and molecules were connected together.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the concept of topological phase transitions can be used to design nonlinear photonic structures exhibiting power thresholds and discontinuities in their transmittance. This provides a novel route to devising nonlinear optical isolators. We study three representative designs: (i) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 1D Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model, (ii) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 2D Haldane model, and (iii) a 2D lattice of coupled-ring waveguides. In the first two cases, we find a correspondence between the topological transition of the underlying linear lattice and the power threshold of the transmittance, and show that the transmission behavior is attributable to the emergence of a self-induced topological soliton. In the third case, we show that the topological transition produces a discontinuity in the transmittance curve, which can be exploited to achieve sharp jumps in the power-dependent isolation ratio.},

Benefiting from the powerful ability of machine learning to learn from big data features, a computational holographic orbital angular momentum (OAM) communication method using OAM hologram encoding and machine learning decoding is proposed. The OAM information representing the grayscale of the images is encoded into different holograms. Subsequently, using a well-trained convolutional neural network, the holograms carrying arbitrary image information can be accurately transmitted and translated, and the hidden OAM information is readout quickly and accurately as an added confidential channel. Topological charge digits can be arranged to form grayscale images or serial codes. Such a computational holographic OAM communication method can be used for extended channels with high security and complexity. In addition, this method can be applied in areas of confidential digital modulation/demodulation and encrypted communication, as well as expand the transmission capacity.},

In order to obtain high-quality audible sound, the system should take full advantage of the nonlinear propagation effect of air and minimize the distortion caused by non-linearity. Presented in this paper is a method of using a nonlinear control algorithm to reduce system distortion. The inverse model of the parametric array nonlinear system is established using a neural network. The effectiveness of this control algorithm is verified by the inverse control simulation of different types of audio signals. According to the established system model, the sound distortion of the system is reduced effectively. In order to optimize the directivity of the speaker array, a method based on changing the distribution of the transducer voltage is proposed. This study has important implications for the directed propagation of audible sounds in the air.},

In this paper, the signal processing algorithm of transmitting end and receiving end of parametric array sonar was studied, and a parametric array sub-bottom profiler was designed and realized for experimental verification. Based on Berktay’s far-field solution, the performance of different modulation methods was analyzed and compared, and suppressed carrier double-sideband modulation was chosen as the optimal modulation method. Furthermore, corresponding echo signal processing algorithm was designed to improve the detection resolution. According to lake trials of the broadband parametric array sub-bottom profile measurement system as designed, a clear sub-bottom profile was obtained, which verified the system’s effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Extreme impedance mismatch causes sound insulation at water–air interfaces, limiting numerous cross-media applications such as ocean-air wireless acoustic communication. Although quarter-wave impedance transformers can improve transmission, they are not readily available for acoustics and are restricted by the fixed phase shift at full transmission. Here, this limitation is broken through impedance-matched hybrid metasurfaces assisted by topology optimization. Sound transmission enhancement and phase modulation across the water–air interface are achieved independently. Compared to the bare water–air interface, it is experimentally observed that the average transmitted amplitude through an impedance-matched metasurface at the peak frequency is enhanced by ≈25.9 dB, close to the limit of the perfect transmission 30 dB. And nearly 42 dB amplitude enhancement is measured by the hybrid metasurfaces with axial focusing function. Various customized vortex beams are experimentally realized to promote applications in ocean-air communication. The physical mechanisms of sound transmission enhancement for broadband and wide-angle incidences are revealed. The proposed concept has potential applications in efficient transmission and free communication across dissimilar media.},

Based on modal-expansion and mode-matching methods, it is theoretically shown that the extremely anisotropic metasurface shell can support varied orders of Mie resonances around the rigid core. We further experimentally demonstrate that the Mie resonance with a dipolelike profile is strongly excited under the illumination of a plane wave at low frequencies, enabling the sensitive directional sensing due to the intensified and azimuthally dependent pressure field.},

  abstract = {The fine manipulation of sound fields is critical in acoustics yet is restricted by the coupled amplitude and phase modulations in existing wave-steering metamaterials. Commonly, unavoidable losses make it difficult to control coupling, thereby limiting device performance. Here we show the possibility of tailoring the loss in metamaterials to realize fine control of sound in three-dimensional (3D) space. Quantitative studies on the parameter dependence of reflection amplitude and phase identify quasi-decoupled points in the structural parameter space, allowing arbitrary amplitude-phase combinations for reflected sound. We further demonstrate the significance of our approach for sound manipulation by producing self-bending beams, multifocal focusing, and a single-plane two-dimensional hologram, as well as a multi-plane 3D hologram with quality better than the previous phase-controlled approach. Our work provides a route for harnessing sound via engineering the loss, enabling promising device applications in acoustics and related fields.},

  abstract = {Acoustic holograms have promising applications in sound-field reconstruction, particle manipulation, ultrasonic haptics, and therapy. This study reports on the theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation of multiplexed acoustic holograms at both audio and ultrasonic frequencies via a rationally designed transmission-type acoustic metamaterial. The proposed metahologram is composed of two Fabry–Pérot resonant channels per unit cell, which enables the simultaneous modulation of the transmitted amplitude and phase at two desired frequencies. In contrast to conventional acoustic metamaterial-based holograms, the design strategy proposed here provides a new degree of freedom (frequency) that can actively tailor holograms that are otherwise completely passive and significantly enhances the information encoded in acoustic metamaterials. To demonstrate the multiplexed acoustic metamaterial, the projection of two different high-quality metaholograms is first shown at 14 and 17 kHz, with the patterns of the letters N and S. Then, two-channel ultrasound focusing and annular beams generation for the incident ultrasonic frequencies of 35 and 42.5 kHz are demonstrated. These multiplexed acoustic metaholograms offer a technical advance to tackle the rising challenges in the fields of acoustic metamaterials, architectural acoustics, and medical ultrasound.},

Typically, single-mode lasing is attainable close to threshold, but increasing the pump power gives rise to multiple lasing peaks due to inter-modal gain competition. We propose a laser with the opposite behavior: multimode lasing occurs at low output powers, but pumping beyond a certain value produces a single lasing mode, with all other candidate modes experiencing negative effective gain. This phenomenon arises in a lattice of coupled optical resonators with non-fine-tuned asymmetric couplings, and is caused by an interaction between nonlinear gain saturation and the non-Hermitian skin effect. The single-mode lasing is observed in both frequency domain and time domain simulations. It is robust against on-site disorder, and scales up to large lattice sizes. This finding might be useful for implementing high-power laser arrays.},

  abstract = {For active control of road noise inside a vehicle, many reference signals are required in adaptive control systems, resulting in slow convergence speeds and heavy computational loads. In this paper, a means of reducing the computational complexity of adaptive control algorithms is investigated based on the fast-converging least-mean-squares Newton (LMS-Newton) algorithm. By analyzing the autocorrelation matrix of reference signals filtered by secondary paths, it is found that the dimensions of the autocorrelation matrix of filtered reference signals do not necessarily have to equal the dimensions of the adaptive control filters, and instead the dimensions can be determined from the correlation between reference signals filtered by secondary paths. Then a computationally efficient segment-update block algorithm is proposed that splits adaptive control filters into several segments and the coefficients of each segment are updated independently. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed segment-update block algorithm has similar convergence speed and noise-reduction performance as the traditional LMS-Newton algorithm when a segment of appropriate length is chosen, but the computational complexity is reduced dramatically because the inverse autocorrelation matrix is replaced by a smaller matrix. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulation experiments with different recorded road noises and secondary paths, and the results are compared with those of some typical algorithms. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved a similar noise-reduction performance with an approximately 8.9-times reduction of computational complexity compared with the traditional LMS-Newton algorithm.},

  abstract = {While chirality imbalances are forbidden in conventional lattice systems, non-Hermiticity can effectively avoid the chiral-doubling theorem to facilitate 1D chiral dynamics. Indeed, such systems support unbalanced unidirectional flows that can lead to the localization of an extensive number of states at the boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Recently, a generalized (rank-2) chirality describing a 2D robust gapless mode with dispersion ω\,=\,kxky has been introduced in crystalline systems. Here we demonstrate that rank-2 chirality imbalances can be established in a non-Hermitian (NH) lattice system leading to momentum-resolved chiral dynamics, and a rank-2 NHSE where there are both edge- and corner-localized skin modes. We then experimentally test this phenomenology in a 2-dimensional topolectric circuit that implements a NH Hamiltonian with a long-lived rank-2 chiral mode. Using impedance measurements, we confirm the rank-2 NHSE in this system, and its manifestation in the predicted skin modes and a highly unusual momentum-position locking response. Our investigation demonstrates a circuit-based path to exploring higher-rank chiral physics, with potential applications in systems where momentum resolution is necessary, e.g., in beamformers and non-reciprocal devices.},

  abstract = {The concept of topological energy bands and their manifestations have been demonstrated in condensed matter systems as a fantastic paradigm toward unprecedented physical phenomena and properties that are robust against disorders. Recent years, this paradigm was extended to phononic metamaterials (including mechanical and acoustic metamaterials), giving rise to the discovery of remarkable phenomena that were not observed elsewhere thanks to the extraordinary controllability and tunability of phononic metamaterials as well as versatile measuring techniques. These phenomena include, but not limited to, topological negative refraction, topological 'sasers' (i.e., the phonon analog of lasers), higher-order topological insulating states, non-Abelian topological phases, higher-order Weyl semimetal phases, Majorana-like modes in Dirac vortex structures and fragile topological phases with spectral flows. Here we review the developments in the field of topological phononic metamaterials from both theoretical and experimental perspectives with emphasis on the underlying physics principles. To give a broad view of topological phononics, we also discuss the synergy with non-Hermitian effects and cover topics including synthetic dimensions, artificial gauge fields, Floquet topological acoustics, bulk topological transport, topological pumping, and topological active matters as well as potential applications, materials fabrications and measurements of topological phononic metamaterials. Finally, we discuss the challenges, opportunities and future developments in this intriguing field and its potential impact on physics and materials science.},

  abstract = {A steerable parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) aims to steer a highly directional audio beam without the need to mechanically rotate the source. The Gaussian beam expansion (GBE) method is often used to model PALs because it is a computationally efficient approach, however the method relies on a paraxial approximation that can result in significant inaccuracies at large steering angles. To address this limitation, a steerable non-paraxial GBE is proposed in this article, where the mainlobe of the steered ultrasonic beam is included in the calculation by rotating the coordinate system. A non-paraxial approximation is then used to improve the accuracy of the method when integrating the virtual audio sources. The numerical results obtained using the proposed method are compared against those using the conventional GBE, as well as an exact solution. For a typical configuration, it is shown that for a conventional GBE the prediction error can be more than 30\,dB at large angles, whereas the proposed method reduces this to less than 1\,dB. The advantage of the proposed method is more significant at large steering angles, low audio frequencies, and those locations outside of the paraxial region. This improvement in performance is achieved with a computational cost that remains the same as the conventional GBE.},

  abstract = {This thesis work contains two major parts. In the first part, ultrasonic wave propagation in multilayer structure is investigated. Delaminations between ceramic and electrode layers in multilayer capacitors and multilayer actuators are common defects, which are difficult to detect using traditional ultrasonic imaging method if the size is smaller than 50 microns in diameter. The T-Matrix method is used to treat wave attenuation in periodic structures with alternating ceramic and electrode layers. Multiple penny-shaped delaminations are assumed perpendicular to the incidence wave, and the forward scattering amplitude of the wave from delaminations is calculated by substituting the average effective crack opening displacement into the scattered wave displacement. The effective phase velocity, wave amplitude and the attenuation coefficient have been calculated for different crack densities. The results provide a theoretical base for potential attenuation based ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method. The second part is a study on matching layers. Matching layers are crucial components in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging. Without proper matching layers, large acoustic impedance mismatch between piezoelectric resonator and the human body tissue will cause most of the ultrasound energy to be reflected at the interface. For a given frequency, the matching layer thickness should be one quarter of the wavelength and its acoustic impedance should be the geometric mean of the acoustic impedances of piezoelectric material and the imaging body. There are no natural materials that can precisely meet such requirements. Therefore, solid particle/polymer composites are commonly used as matching layer materials. The acoustic impedance of such composites is generally in the range of 2-15 MRayls. It is a routine task to make such composite for low frequency transducers, but for transducers with operating frequency higher than 40 MHz, the powder size must be sub-microns in order to reduce wave scattering because the wavelength is much smaller. High volume loading fine powder composite is very difficult to make using conventional composite fabrication technique because air bubbles will be trapped in the mixture. Therefore, all ultrahigh frequency transducers currently used or under development are not properly matched because the lacking of desired matching layer materials. This problem hinders the development of finer resolution ultrahigh frequency ultrasonic imaging. There are some progress made in the past 3 years and there are sol-gel SiO2/polymer nano-composites being developed that can have acoustic impedance up to 5.7 MRays. In this thesis work, TiO2 nano-structured material has been developed. The material has porous nano-structure with the volume fraction of voids being controlled by the amount of bonding amorphous phase in the material and its acoustic impedance can be further tuned by heat treatment at slightly elevated temperatures. Using the quarter wavelength thickness characterization method, the acoustic properties of this nanostructured material were accurately characterized. It was found that the acoustic impedance can reach as high as 7.19 MRayls, which is a concrete improvement compared to that of the best nano-composites available. Because of recent rapid development of the single crystal PMN-PT and PZT-PT materials for medical ultrasonic transducer applications, there is a new excitement to develop transducers with very broad bandwidth because the electromechanical coupling coefficient of these single crystals are better than 90\%. For such very broad bandwidth transducers, the front matching layer will be the limiting factor because the quarter wavelength matching layer acts like a filter whose bandwidth is generally less than 100\%. One of the main tasks of this thesis is to investigate matching layer design with gradient acoustic impedance to achieve much broader bandwidth ({$>$}100\%). Wave propagation within an inhomogeneous multilayer structure has been analyzed and simulated using the finite difference time domain numerical technique. By adjusting the acoustic impedance distribution function, we have found the best gradient design which has super broad bandwidth. In fact, the passband only has a low frequency cut-off and it works for almost all frequencies beyond the cut-off frequency. To certain extend, this optimized design is universal so that such a matching layer can be used in all medical transducers of different frequencies.},

  abstract = {We present acoustic modeling, measurements, and interpretation of the angular momentum carried in an ultrasonic vortex beam that is obliquely reflected off a flat water-air interface. The experimental measurements observe the theoretically predicted reversals of phase rotation, topological charge, and orbital angular momentum in a reflected vortex beam in direct analogy to optical phenomena. The spatial and temporal evolution of the linear and angular momentum during the reflection are determined by calculating the velocity field from two-dimensional scanned pressure fields. A conversion of the angular momentum indicates a radiation torque along the oblique reflecting surface. We understand this radiation torque originates from the break of rotational symmetry with respect to the incident plane for normal components of the energy flux and linear momentum density at the reflecting surface. Our study provides mechanical evidence on the effect of a flat surface on the reflection of vortex beams and gains insight into the underlying physics, impacting non-contact manipulation of objects and communication.},

It is used in a variety of applications such as source localization, reproduction, and power measurement. Until now, intensity is defined at a point in space, however given sound propagates over space, knowing its spatial distribution could be more powerful. This paper formulates spatial sound intensity vectors in spherical harmonic domain such that the vectors contain energy and directivity information over continuous spatial regions. These representations are derived with finite sets of closed form coefficients enabling ease of implementation.},

  abstract = {In literature, particle velocity has been introduced to improve performance of spatial sound field reproduction systems. However, all existing work requires to have accurate particle velocity measurements at all of the discrete control points, which is difficult to obtain in real-world applications. In this work, we formulate continuous particle velocity expressions over space as a function of pressure coefficients in the modal domain that can be easily extracted by using a higher order microphone. The sound field within a target region is controlled by a weighted cost function we built to optimize the continuous particle velocity, as well as sound pressure, on the boundary of the region. In contrast to the conventional spatial sound field reproduction methods in the modal domain, the proposed method allows for non-uniform loudspeaker geometry with a limited number of loudspeakers, thus providing a flexible array arrangement. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through numerical simulations in both a free field and a reverberant room. Finally, we prove the proposed method in an objective experiment with real-world measurements of room impulse response.},
